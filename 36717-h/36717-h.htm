<h1>Molly Brown&rsquo;s Junior Days</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>DAUGHTERS OF WELLINGTON.</small></h2>


<p>No.&nbsp;5 in the Quadrangle at Wellington College
was in a condition of upheaval. Surprising
things were happening there. The simultaneous
arrival of six trunks, five express boxes and a
piano had thrown the three orderly and not over-large
rooms into a state of the wildest confusion.</p>

<p>In the midst of this mountain of luggage and
scattered boxes stood a small, lonely figure
dressed in brown, gazing disconsolately about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I had been cast up by an earthquake
with a lot of other miscellaneous things,&rdquo;
she remarked hopelessly.</p>

<p>It was Nance Oldham, back at college by an
early train, and devoutly wishing she had waited
for the four-ten when the others were expected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too much to face alone,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;If it had been at Queen&rsquo;s it never would
have happened. Mrs. Markham wouldn&rsquo;t have
allowed six trunks and a piano and five boxes to
be piled into one room. And mine at the very
bottom, too. If it wasn&rsquo;t a selfish act, I think I&rsquo;d
leave everything and go call on Mrs. McLean&mdash;but,
no, that wouldn&rsquo;t do on the first day.&rdquo; Nance
blushed. &ldquo;But Andy&rsquo;s there to-day.&rdquo; She
blushed again at this bold, outspoken thought.
&ldquo;I shall get the janitor to come up here and distribute
these things,&rdquo; she added presently, with
New England determination not even to peep at
a picture of pleasure behind a granite wall of
duty.</p>

<p>The doors of No.&nbsp;5 opened on a broad, high-ceiled
corridor, the side walls of which were
wainscoted halfway up with dark polished wood.
On either side of this corridor ranged the apartments
and single rooms of the Quadrangle, one
row facing the campus, the other the courtyard.
An occasional upholstered bench or high-backed
chair stood between the frequent doors and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a home-like touch to the long gallery. They had
been the gift of a rich ex-graduate.</p>

<p>Nance, closing the door of No.&nbsp;5, paused and
looked proudly down the polished vista of the
hallway, which curved at the far end and continued
its way on the other side of the Quadrangle.</p>

<p>The sound of voices and laughter floated to
her through the half open doors of the other
rooms. With a smile of contentment, she sat
down in one of the high-backed chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old Wellington,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;other
girls love their homes, but I love you.&rdquo; Thus
she apostrophized the classic shades of the university
while her gaze lighted absently on a large
laundry bag stuffed full standing just outside
one of the doors. It was different from the usual
Wellington laundry bag, being of a peculiar shape
and of material covered with Japanese fans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Otoyo&rsquo;s. Of course, she must have been
here since Monday. I heard she had spent the
summer down in the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hastened along the green path of carpet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
running down the middle of the corridor and
paused at the room of the Japanese laundry bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otoyo Sen,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come
out and meet your friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Japanese girl was seated on the floor gazing
at a photograph. She rose quickly and flew
to the door, thrusting the picture behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so deeply happee to see you again,
Mees Oldham,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has learned the use of adverbs,&rdquo; thought
Nance, kissing Otoyo&rsquo;s round dark cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see I have been studying long time. I
now speak the language with correctness. Do
you not think so?&rdquo; said Otoyo, apparently reading
Nance&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; answered Nance. &ldquo;But tell me
the news. Is Queen&rsquo;s not to be rebuilt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. Queen&rsquo;s is to remain flat on the
ground. She will not be erected into another
building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you had a happy summer? Was it
quite lonesome for you, poor child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested Otoyo, still hiding the photograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
behind her. &ldquo;Those who remained at
Wellington were most kind to little Japanese
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who remained, Otoyo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Green was here long time. I studied
the English language under him. He is a
great man. It is an honorable pleasure to learn
from one so great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, indeed. And who else? Any of the
rest of the faculty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. They had all departing gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance smiled. There was still a relic of last
year&rsquo;s English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. McLean and her family remained at
Wellington through the entire summer,&rdquo; went
on Otoyo fluently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And were they nice to you, Otoyo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Veree, exceedinglee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Andy well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; replied the Japanese girl, backing
off from Nance and slipping the photograph
into a book.</p>

<p>Not for many a day did Nance find out that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was a portrait of that youth himself, taken at the
age of eight in Scotch kilties and a little black
velvet hat with two streamers down the back.</p>

<p>Suddenly Otoyo became very voluble. She
changed the subject and talked in rapid, smooth
English. Could she not see the new rooms of
her friends? She understood everybody was
coming down on the four-ten train. It would be
very crowded. She had found a new laundress
whom she could highly recommend.</p>

<p>Nance looked at her curiously as they strolled
back to the other rooms. Something was changed
about the little Japanese girl. She seemed older
and much less timid.</p>

<p>It was Miss Sen who found the man to move
the trunks, and who helped Nance unpack her
things and lay them in half the chest of drawers;
and it was Otoyo, also, who, with the skill of an
artisan, removed all the nails from the express
box tops so that they might be unpacked immediately
by their owners. At lunch time she led
Nance into the great dining hall of the Quadrangle
where more than a hundred girls ate their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
meals three times a day. There was no attention
she did not show to Nance, and all because her
conscience was heavy within her on account of
the one dishonorable act of her life. How could
she know that among the scores of photographs
taken of young Andy from his babyhood to his
present age, Mrs. McLean would never miss one
small, faded picture out of the pile thrust into a
cabinet drawer?</p>

<p>At last it came time to meet the four-ten, and
Nance, looking spic and span in fresh white duck
and white shoes and stockings, was rather surprised
to find Otoyo also attired in a pretty white
dress, her face shaded with a Leghorn hat
trimmed with pink roses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Sen,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;how did you
learn so soon to dress yourself in this charming
American style?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At a garden party at Mrs. McLean&rsquo;s I learned
a very many things,&rdquo; said Otoyo, &ldquo;and by the
purchasing agent I have obtained dresses of summer,
of duckling, lining and musling; also this
hat and two others very pretty.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Nance laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean duck, linen and muslin, child,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>When the four-ten train to Wellington pulled
into the station it seemed as if every student in
the university must be crowded inside. They
leaned from the windows and packed the doorways,
overflowing onto the platforms.</p>

<p>The air vibrated with high feminine shrieks
of joy. Only the poor little freshies were silent
in all this jubilation of reunions. Suddenly
Nance, spying Molly Brown and Judy Kean,
rushed to meet them, Otoyo following at her
heels like a toy spaniel after a larger dog. There
was a long triangular embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are, <em>and juniors</em>,&rdquo; was Judy&rsquo;s
first comment. &ldquo;Nance, you&rsquo;re looking fine as
silk. No sign of travel on that snowy gown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There oughtn&rsquo;t to be,&rdquo; said Nance. &ldquo;I just
put it on half an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look at our little Jap,&rdquo; cried Molly, hugging
Otoyo. &ldquo;Look at little Miss Sen, all dressed
up in a beautiful linen.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Miss Sen has been learning a thing or
two,&rdquo; said Nance. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been to parties, she&rsquo;s
been studying English under a famous professor;
she&rsquo;s been buying duckling, lining and musling
dresses through a purchasing agent with
very good taste, and she&rsquo;s got a photograph she
looks at in private and hides away when any one
comes into the room. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t think I
didn&rsquo;t see you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otoyo blushed scarlet and hung her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thou crafty one,&rdquo; Judy was saying, when
four of the old Queen&rsquo;s girls pounced on them
with suit cases and satchels. &ldquo;Why, here are the
Gemini,&rdquo; Judy continued, embracing the Williams
sisters. &ldquo;Burned to a mahogany brown, too.
Where did you get that tan? You look like a
pair of&mdash;hum&mdash;Filipinos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be making invidious remarks, Judy,&rdquo;
put in Katherine. &ldquo;Learn to see the beautiful
in all things, even complexions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime Margaret Wakefield, looking
five years older than her real age because of her
matured figure and self-possessed air, was shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
hands all around, making an appropriate
remark with each greeting, like the politician she
was; and Jessie Lynch was crying in heartbroken
tones:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left a box of candy and a bunch of violets
and two new magazines on the train!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my little freshman?&rdquo; Molly demanded
of the other girls above the din and
racket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; Judy pointed out. &ldquo;But there
is no hurry. Every bus is jammed full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lonely freshman was standing pressed
against the wall of the waiting room looking
hopelessly on while the usual mob besieged Mr.
Murphy, baggage master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the poor little thing,&rdquo; cried Molly, rushing
to take the girl under her wing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s astonishing how one good deed starts another,&rdquo;
thought Nance, looking about her for
other stranded freshies; and both the Williamses
were doing the same thing.</p>

<p>There were several such lonely souls wandering
about like lost spirits. They had been jostled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and pushed this way and that in the crowd,
and one little girl was on the point of shedding
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can always tell a new girl by the wild light
in her eye,&rdquo; observed Edith Williams, making
for an unhappy looking young person who had
given up in despair and was sitting on her suit
case.</p>

<p>At last they were all bundled into one of the
larger buses from the livery stable. The older
girls were thrilled with expectant joy while they
watched eagerly for the first glimpse of the twin
gray towers; the new girls, most of them, gazed
sadly the other way, as if home lay behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a case of &lsquo;abandon hope all ye who
enter here,&rsquo;&rdquo; observed Judy to a dejected freshman
who in five minutes had lost all interest in
her college career. &ldquo;Look at us blooming creatures
and you&rsquo;ll see what it can do. There&rsquo;s no
end to the fun of it and no end to the things you&rsquo;ll
learn besides mere book knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said the girl, struggling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
keep back her tears, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a little lonesome at
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little souls,&rdquo; thought Molly, who had
overheard with much pride Judy&rsquo;s eulogy of college,
&ldquo;how can we explain it to them? They&rsquo;ll
just have to find it out themselves as we did before
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth is, our new juniors felt quite motherly
and old.</p>

<p>A hushed silence fell over the Queen&rsquo;s girls
when the bus drove by the grass-grown plot
where once had stood their college home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a dear friend had been buried there, we
couldn&rsquo;t have felt more solemn,&rdquo; Molly wrote her
sister that night.</p>

<p>But the prestige felt in alighting finally at the
great arched entrance to the Quadrangle drove
away all sad thoughts, and when they hastened
down the long polished corridor to their rooms,
they could not quench the pride which rose in
their breasts. It was the real thing at last.
Queen&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s had been great fun, but
this was college. They were the true daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of Wellington now, and that night when the
gates clicked together at ten, they would sleep
for the first time behind her gray stone walls.</p>

<p>At that moment the voices of a hundred-odd
other daughters hummed through the halls, but
it was all a part of the college atmosphere, as
Judy said.</p>

<p>Their bedrooms were not quite as large as the
old Queen&rsquo;s rooms, but oh, the sitting room!
They viewed it with pride. Each of the three
had contributed something toward additional furniture.
The piano was Judy&rsquo;s; the divan,
Nance&rsquo;s; and the cushions, yet to be unpacked,
Molly&rsquo;s. There was another contribution not
made by any of the three. It was the beautiful
Botticelli photograph left for Molly by Mary
Stewart, who had gone to Europe for the winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How glad I am the walls are pale yellow and
the woodwork white!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy joyfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How glad I am there&rsquo;s plenty of room on these
shelves for everybody&rsquo;s books,&rdquo; said Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how glad I am to be a junior and back
at old Wellington,&rdquo; finished Molly, squeezing a
hand of each friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>MINERVA HIGGINS.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing worse than a faculty
call-down and that&rsquo;s a Beta Phi freeze-out,&rdquo; remarked
Judy Kean one Saturday afternoon a few
weeks after the opening day of college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you bring up disagreeable subjects,
Judy? Have you been getting a call-down?&rdquo;
asked Katherine Williams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not your old Aunty Judy,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m far too wise for that after two years&rsquo; experience,
but I saw some one else get one of the
most flattening, extinguishing, crushing call-downs
ever received by an inmate of this asylum
for young ladies. And they do tell me it was followed
soon after by another one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do tell,&rdquo; exclaimed an interested chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was that fresh Miss Higgins from Ohio,&rdquo;
continued Judy, with some enjoyment of the curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
she was exciting. &ldquo;You know she&rsquo;s always
trying to attract the attention of the masses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We being the masses,&rdquo; interrupted Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And stand in the limelight. She&rsquo;s bright, I
hear, very bright, but she knows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recognized her type almost immediately,&rdquo;
said Katherine. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of those brightest-girls-in-the-high-school-pride-of-the-town
kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; answered Judy. &ldquo;She has been regarded
as a prodigy for so long that she doesn&rsquo;t
understand the relative difference between a
freshman and a senior. I honestly believe she
thought everybody in Wellington knew all about
her, and she wears as many gold medals on her
chest as a field marshal on dress parade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw the gold medals on Sunday,&rdquo; interposed
Molly. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s rather pathetic, myself.
She is more to be pitied than scorned, because
of course she doesn&rsquo;t know any better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to live and learn, then,&rdquo; said Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get to the point of your story, Judy. Who extinguished
her?&rdquo; ejaculated Margaret Wakefield,
impatient of such slipshod methods of narration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell a tale when I&rsquo;m interrupted by
forty people at once?&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;Besides,
I haven&rsquo;t the gift of language like you, old suffragette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. She was entirely good-natured
over the jibes of her friends about her passion
for universal suffrage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the Beta Phi crowd of seniors,&rdquo; went on
Judy, &ldquo;were walking across the campus in a row.
I don&rsquo;t suppose Miss Higgins had any way to
know this soon in the game that they represented
the triple extract of concentrated exclusiveness
at Wellington. Anyhow, she knows it now. She
came rushing up behind them and gave Rosomond
a light, friendly slap on the back. If you
could have seen Rosomond&rsquo;s face! But Miss Higgins
was entirely dense. She began something
about &lsquo;Hello, girls, have you heard the news
about Prexy&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; but she never got any further.
Rosomond gave her the most freezing look I ever
saw from a human eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was it. She never said anything. Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
said anything. Eloise Blair carries tortoise-shell
lorgnettes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t need them,&rdquo; broke in Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She only does it to make herself more haughty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Eloise raised the lorgnettes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Miss Higgins,&rdquo; cried Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was perfect silence for about a minute.
Then they all walked on, leaving little Higgins
standing alone in the middle of the campus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where were you?&rdquo; asked Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was with the seniors,&rdquo; answered Judy,
flushing slightly. &ldquo;I had been over to Beta Phi
to see Rosomond about something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was impossible for Judy&rsquo;s friends not to
make an amiable unspoken guess as to why she
had visited the Beta Phi circle. It had been evident
for some time that she was working to get
into the &ldquo;Shakespeareans,&rdquo; the most exclusive
dramatic club in college. There was an awkward
silence as this thought flashed through their
minds. Molly felt embarrassed for her chum.
After all, she was no worse than Margaret Wakefield,
who had managed to get herself elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
three years in succession as president of her
class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the other extinguisher Miss Higgins
had, Judy?&rdquo; asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. That was even worse. It came
from your particular friend, Professor Green.
She interrupted him in the middle of a lecture
with one of those unnecessary questions new girls
ask to show how much they know. And then
she said something about methods at Mill Town
High School.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; chorused the voices. &ldquo;And what
did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked very much bored and replied that
they were not interested in Mill Town High
School, and he would be obliged if she would pay
attention to the lecture. It was a public rebuke,
nothing more nor less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mean thing,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Molly,&rdquo; interposed Margaret, &ldquo;you
know very well that girls of that type ought to
be taken down. They are never tolerated at college.
A conceited boy at college is always thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
hazed until there&rsquo;s not a drop of conceit
left, and it does him good. And since we can&rsquo;t
haze, we simply have to extinguish a fresh
freshie. Miss Higgins may develop into a very
nice girl in a year or two, but at present she&rsquo;s the
veriest little upstart&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do be careful,&rdquo; said Molly cautiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
invited her this afternoon to drink tea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly Brown,&rdquo; they cried, pummeling her
with sofa cushions and beating her with her own
slippers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Molly, you must restrain your inviting
habits,&rdquo; said Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; apologized poor Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it, pray? You know perfectly
well no one here wants her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but I was sorry for her. She
seemed so brash and lonesome at the same time.
I thought it might help her some to mingle with
a few fine, intelligent, well-bred girls like
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, here! Don&rsquo;t try to get out of it that
way.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She appears to be very learned,&rdquo; continued
Molly, turning her blue eyes innocently from one
to the other. &ldquo;I thought it would be nice to pit
her against Margaret and Edith. She discusses
deep subjects and uses big words I can only dimly
guess the meaning of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; There was a tap at
the door. &ldquo;Now, be nice, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called Nance, in a tone of authority,
and Minerva Higgins appeared in their
midst.</p>

<p>She had done honor to the occasion by putting
on a taffeta silk of indigo blue, and by pinning
on some of her most conspicuous gold medals
acquired at intervals during her early education.</p>

<p>Judy shook her head over the indigo blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only certain minds could wear it,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>

<p>Molly rose, but before she could frame a cordial
greeting, the new guest was saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Molly? Awfully nice of you
to ask me. You don&rsquo;t mind my calling you by
your first name, do you? My name is Minerva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
but the girls at Mill Town High School called
me &lsquo;Minnie.&rsquo; I hope you&rsquo;ll do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to,&rdquo; answered Molly, rather
taken back by this sudden intimacy.</p>

<p>After she had performed all necessary introductions,
wicked Katherine Williams remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Minnie is a very charming name, but I insist
on calling you &lsquo;Minerva&rsquo; after the Goddess of
Wisdom. She never wore gold medals, but then
it wasn&rsquo;t the fashion among the early Greeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minerva&rsquo;s face was the picture of complacency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Greece she would have been &lsquo;Athene,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she observed.</p>

<p>There was a loud clearing of throats and Judy,
as usual, was seized with a violent fit of coughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down here, Miss Higgins&mdash;I mean Minnie,&rdquo;
said Molly hastily. &ldquo;The tea will be ready
in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been to college before, Minerva?&rdquo;
asked Edith Williams solemnly.</p>

<p>Minerva looked somewhat surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Not college. I am just out of High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
School. Mill Town High School is a very wonderful
educational institution, you know. Perhaps
you have heard of it. A diploma from there
will admit a girl into any of the best colleges in
the country. I could have gone to a private
school. My father is professor of Greek at the
Academy in Mill Town, but I preferred to take
advantage of the high standards of the High
School, which are even higher than those of the
Academy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose your father&rsquo;s taste in Greek caused
him to name you Minerva,&rdquo; observed Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Minerva isn&rsquo;t Greek, Julia,&rdquo; admonished
Katherine.</p>

<p>Again Molly interceded. It was cruel to make
fun of the poor girl, although there was no denying
that Minerva had a high opinion of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a sandwich,&rdquo; she said soothingly.</p>

<p>There was a long interval of silence while
Minerva crunched her sandwich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your life at Mill Town High School must
have been one grand triumphal progress, judging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
from your medals, Miss Higgins,&rdquo; said Edith
Williams finally.</p>

<p>Minerva glanced proudly down at the awards
of merit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a good many of them,&rdquo; she observed,
with a smile that was almost more than
they could stand. &ldquo;And there are more of them
still. I&rsquo;ve won one or two medals each year ever
since I started to school. But I don&rsquo;t like to wear
them all at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very modest of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to specialize on any subjects,
Miss Higgins?&rdquo; asked Margaret Wakefield,
really meaning to be kind and lead the girl away
from topics which made her appear ridiculous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Biology, I think. But I am interested in
Comparative Philology, too, and after I skim
through a little Greek and Latin, I intend to take
up some of the ancient languages, Sanskrit and
Hebrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it possible that Minerva was making game
of them? They regarded her suspiciously, but
she seemed sublimely unconscious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not study also the ancient tongue of the
Basques?&rdquo; asked Edith, quite gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be interesting,&rdquo; replied Minerva,
&ldquo;but I want to get through this little college
course first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly batted her heavenly eyes and suddenly
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be
rude, but the course at Wellington doesn&rsquo;t seem
so small to us. We have to study all the time and
then just barely pull through. I&rsquo;ve almost flunked
twice in mathematics. I wish I could call it a
little course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, we are not all Minervas,&rdquo; observed
Margaret. &ldquo;Some of us are just ordinary school
girls learning the rudiments of education. We
have not had the advantages of Mill Town High
School, and if any of us have won gold medals
we never show them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This measured rebuff, however, had no more
effect on Minerva&rsquo;s impervious vanity than a
cup of water dashed against a granite boulder.
She was already up, wandering about the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
boldly examining the girls&rsquo; belongings, ostentatiously
reading the titles of books aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plays by Molière. Oh, yes, I read them in the
original two years ago. They&rsquo;re easy. &lsquo;Green&rsquo;s
Short History of the English People,&rsquo; very interesting
book. &lsquo;The Broad Highway.&rsquo; I never
read fiction. Only biography and history&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edith Williams, stretched at her ease on the
divan, gave an inaudible groan and turned her
face to the wall.</p>

<p>Molly glanced helplessly about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Primavera,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s by Botticelli,&rdquo; went
on the girl, infatuated by her own intelligence.
&ldquo;Good artist, but I don&rsquo;t care for the old masters
as a general thing. They are always out of drawing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katherine rolled her eyes up into her head
until only the whites could be seen, which gave
her the horrible aspect of a corpse.</p>

<p>There was a long and eloquent silence. Presently
Minerva took her departure, and Molly,
hospitable to the last gasp, saw her to the door
and invited her to come again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>With the door safely locked and Minerva out
of earshot, there was a general collapse. Nobody
laughed, but the room was filled with painful
sounds, moans and groans. Judy pretended to
faint on top of Edith, and Molly sat in a remote
corner of the room.</p>

<p>Somehow, they felt beaten, vanquished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sore all over with repressed emotions,&rdquo;
cried Judy. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand another séance
like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she know as much as she claims?&rdquo; asked
Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret irritably.
&ldquo;If she really knew she wouldn&rsquo;t claim anything.
It&rsquo;s only ignorant people who boast of knowledge.
I suppose she has been looked up to for so long
that she regards herself as a fountain of wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be taken down,&rdquo; said Edith firmly.
&ldquo;This mustn&rsquo;t be allowed to go on at Wellington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But hazing isn&rsquo;t allowed,&rdquo; put in Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by hazing, goosie. By some homely little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
practical joke that will show herself to herself as
others see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; consented Molly. She felt indeed
that something should be done to save poor Minerva
Higgins from eternal ridicule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anybody has suggestions to make,&rdquo; here
announced Margaret Wakefield, self-constituted
chairman of all committees, impromptu or otherwise,
&ldquo;they may be stated in writing or announced
by word of mouth to-morrow night in
our rooms at a fudge party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accepted,&rdquo; they cried in one breath.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Minerva Higgins was writing
home to her mother that she had been, if not
the guest of honor, almost that, at a junior tea,
and had found the girls rather interesting though
poor talkers. In fact, it was necessary to do almost
all the talking herself.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>IN THE CLOISTERS.</small></h2>


<p>Life in the Quadrangle hummed busily on. The
girls found themselves in the very heart of college
affairs. As a matter of fact the old Queen&rsquo;s
circle had been somewhat restricted, having narrowed
down to less than a dozen; whereas now,
they associated with many times that number
and were invited to a bewildering succession of
teas and fudge parties.</p>

<p>Also they were nearer to the library, the gymnasium,
the classrooms and the cloisters. Here,
during the warm, hazy days of Indian summer
Molly loved to walk. It was not such a popular
place as she had imagined with the Quadrangle
girls, and often she was quite alone in the arcade,
bordered now with hydrangeas turning a delicate
pink under the autumn suns.</p>

<p>One afternoon, a few days after Margaret&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fudge party to discuss the question of Minerva
Higgins, Molly sought a few quiet moments in
the cloistered walk. It was a half hour before
closing-up time, but she would not miss the six
strokes of the tower clock again, as she had on
her first day at college two years before.</p>

<p>She usually confined her walks to the far side
of the arcade, keeping well away from the side
of the cloisters on which the studies of some of
the faculty opened. That afternoon she carried
her volume of Rossetti with her, and pacing
slowly up and down, she read in a low musical
voice to herself:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;The blessed damozel leaned out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the gold bar of Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes were deeper than the depth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waters stilled at even;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had three lilies in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stars in her hair were seven.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Waves of rhythm ran through Molly&rsquo;s head,
and when she reached the end of the walk she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
turned mechanically and went the other way
without pausing in her reading.</p>

<p>Many girls studied in this way in the cloisters
and it was not an unusual sight, but Molly made
a picture not soon to be forgotten by any one
who might chance to wander in the arcade at that
hour. She was still spare and undeveloped, but
the grace that was to come revealed itself in the
girlish lines of her figure. Her eyes seemed
never more serenely, deeply blue than now, and
her hair, disordered from the tam o&rsquo;shanter she
had pulled off and tossed onto a stone bench,
made a fluffy auburn frame about her face.
Molly was by no means beautiful from the standpoint
of perfection. Her eyebrows and lashes
should have been darker; her chin was too pointed
and her mouth a shade too large. But few people
took the trouble to pick out flaws in her face
or figure. Those who loved her thought her beautiful,
and the few who did not could not deny her
charm.</p>

<p>Presently she sat down on a bench, continuing
to declaim the poem out aloud, making a gesture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
occasionally with her unoccupied hand.
After reading a verse, she closed her eyes and
repeated it to herself. Opening her eyes between
verses, she encountered the amused gaze of Professor
Edwin Green who, having seen her in the
distance, had cut across the grassy court and now
stood as still as a statue leaning against a stone
pillar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, with a nervous start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="#frontispiece">Did I frighten you? I am sorry.</a> I should
have walked more heavily. It&rsquo;s unkind to steal
up on people who are reading poetry aloud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was learning the&mdash;something by heart,&rdquo; she
said, blushing a little as if she had been detected
in a guilty act. After all, it was the professor
who had introduced her to that poem and given
her the book last Christmas, but that, of course,
was not the reason why she was so fond of the
poem she was studying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like the Quadrangle?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Are you comfortable and happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly clasped her hands in the excess of her
enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was never so happy in all my life,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;It is perfect. Our rooms are beautiful, and a
sitting room, too. Think of that, with yellow
walls and a piano!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor looked vastly pleased. For an
instant his face was lighted by a beaming, radiant
smile. Then he thrust his hands into his
pockets and pressed his lips together in a thin
line of determination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I were one of the workers inside
the hive now,&rdquo; Molly continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all the difficulties about tuition have been
settled?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Forgive my mentioning it,
but I felt an interest on account of my close relationship
to the Blounts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. The money from the two acres of
orchard settled that. You see, whoever bought
it, whether it was an old man or a company&mdash;for
some reason the name is still a secret with the
agent&mdash;paid cash. They rarely do, mother says,
and the money is usually spent in driblets before
you realize it. Mr. Richard Blount expects
to settle with his father&rsquo;s creditors in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
months. My sisters are working. They say they
enjoy it, but they are both engaged to be married,&rdquo;
she added, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the orchard yield a good crop this year?&rdquo;
asked the professor irrelevantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, splendid. The apples were packed in barrels
and sent away. Several of them were sent
to mother as a present. Very nice of the owner,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied the professor, fingering something
in his pocket absently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The owner of the orchard has it kept in fine
condition. The trees have been trimmed and the
ground cleared. Mother says she&rsquo;s ashamed of
her own shiftlessness whenever she looks at it.
The grass was as smooth as velvet all summer
until the drought came and dried it brown. I
used to go there summer mornings and lie in a
hammock and read. I didn&rsquo;t think any one would
care. There&rsquo;s no harm in attaching a hammock
to two trees. Mother says I don&rsquo;t seem to remember
that we are no longer the owners of the
orchard. I have played in it and lived in it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
much of my life that I&rsquo;ve got the habit, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor cleared his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said the ground sloped slightly, did you
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just a gradual slope to a little brook at
the bottom of the hill. The water seems to cool
the air in summer. It never goes dry and there
is a little basin in one place we used to call &lsquo;the
birds&rsquo; bath tub.&rsquo; Such birds you never imagined!
They are attracted by the apples, I suppose. But
there are hundreds of them. They sing from
morning to night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You paint a very attractive picture, Miss
Brown. It must have been hard to give up this
charming property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see we haven&rsquo;t given it up exactly.
It&rsquo;s there right against us. We can still look at
it and even walk under the trees. No one minds.
And see what I have for it! Nothing could ever
take the place of college&mdash;not even an apple
orchard.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>A sharp voice broke in on this pleasant conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin Edwin, I&rsquo;ve been looking for you
everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith Blount appeared hastening down the
walk.</p>

<p>The professor watched the advancing figure
calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now you have found me, what do you
want?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Molly detected a slight note of annoyance in
his voice. She had a notion that Judith was one
of the trials of his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have rewritten the short story you criticized
for me last week, and I want you to look it over
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the roll of paper without a word and
thrust it into his coat pocket.</p>

<p>Molly rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It must be nearly
six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith promptly sat down on the bench facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
her cousin, who still leaned against the stone pillar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a little chilly to be lingering
here, Judith?&rdquo; he remarked politely, as he
joined Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t too chilly for you a moment ago,&rdquo;
answered Judith hotly.</p>

<p>But she rose and walked on the other side of
the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like your rooms?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate them,&rdquo; she replied, with such fierce resentment
that Molly was sure that Judith was
glad to have something on which to vent her angry
mood. &ldquo;Thank heavens, this is my last year.
I detest Wellington. I have never been happy
here. It&rsquo;s brought shame and misfortune on me.
It&rsquo;s a horrid old place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judith,&rdquo; protested Molly, unable to endure
this libel on her beloved college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child, you can&rsquo;t blame Wellington
for your misfortunes,&rdquo; interposed the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
who himself cherished a deep affection for the
two gray towers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard to live in the village instead of at
college,&rdquo; said Molly, feeling suddenly very sorry
for the unhappy Judith.</p>

<p>But Judith was in no state to be sympathized
with. All day she had been nursing a grievance.
One of her friends in prosperity at the Beta Phi
House had turned a cold shoulder on her that
morning; and Judith was so enraged by the
slight that her feelings were like an open sore.</p>

<p>She turned on Molly angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You had to
do it long enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judith, Judith,&rdquo; remonstrated the professor.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand that you gain nothing, and
always lose something, by giving way like this?
Denouncing and hating make the object you are
working for recede. You&rsquo;ll never get it that
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know what I&rsquo;m working for?&rdquo;
she demanded, more quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all of us working for the same thing,&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;Happiness. None of us proposes
to get it in the same way, but all of us propose to
reach the same goal. What would give me happiness
no doubt would never satisfy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that, either. What would
give you happiness?&rdquo; Judith asked, with some
curiosity.</p>

<p>The professor paused a moment, then he said
calmly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little home of my own in a shady quiet
place with plenty of old trees, where I could
work in peace. I have always fancied an old orchard.
There might be a brook at one end&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinking of my orchard,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be hundreds of birds in my orchard,&rdquo;
went on the professor, &ldquo;and the grass
must always be thick and green, except perhaps
when the drought comes and it can&rsquo;t help itself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The six o&rsquo;clock bell boomed out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have an apple,&rdquo; he said, taking two red apples
from his pocket and giving one to each of
the girls.</p>

<p>Then he opened the small oak door and stood
politely aside while they passed out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>A LITERARY EVENING.</small></h2>


<p>The entertainment designed to bring Miss Minerva
Higgins to a true understanding of her
position as a freshman took place one Friday
evening in the rooms of Margaret and Jessie. It
was called on the invitation &ldquo;A Literary Evening,&rdquo;
and was to be in the nature of a spread and
fudge affair. There had been two rehearsals beforehand,
and the girls were now prepared to
enjoy themselves thoroughly.</p>

<p>Molly was loath to take part in the literary
evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to see anybody humiliated even
when she ought to be,&rdquo; she said, but she consented
to come and to give a recitation.</p>

<p>Several study tables had been united for the
supper, the cracks concealed by Japanese towelling
contributed by Otoyo. There was no Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Murphy in the Quadrangle from whom to borrow
tablecloths. All the chairs from the other rooms
were brought in to seat the company, who appeared
grave and subdued. Most of the girls
were dressed to resemble famous poets and authors.
Judy was Byron; Margaret Wakefield,
George Eliot; Nance, Charlotte Bronté; Edith
Williams, Edgar Allan Poe; and Molly was Shelley.
Shakespeare, Voltaire and Charles Dickens
were in the company, and &ldquo;The Duchess,&rdquo; impersonated
by Jessie Lynch.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Minerva was a little disconcerted
at first when she found herself the only
girl at the feast in her own character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, so that I could have
come in costume, too?&rdquo; she asked Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you had your medals,&rdquo; was Margaret&rsquo;s
enigmatic answer.</p>

<p>Minerva looked puzzled. Then her gaze fell
to the shining breastplate of silver and gold
trophies. She had worn them all this evening.
The temptation had been too great. The medals
gleamed like so many solemn eyes. She wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
if the others could read what was inscribed
on them, or if it would be necessary to call attention
to the most choice ones: &ldquo;THE HIGHEST
GENERAL AVERAGE FOR FOUR
YEARS&rdquo;; &ldquo;REGULAR ATTENDANCE&rdquo;;
&ldquo;MATHEMATICS&rdquo;; &ldquo;THE BEST HISTORICAL
ESSAY&rdquo;; &ldquo;ENGLISH AND COMPOSITION.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edith opened the evening by delivering a
speech in Latin which was really one of Virgil&rsquo;s
eclogues mixed up with whatever she could recall
of Livy and Horace, and filled out occasionally
with Latin prose composition. It was so excruciatingly
funny that Judy sputtered in her
tea and was well kicked on her shins under the
table.</p>

<p>Minerva, however, appeared to be profoundly
impressed, and the company murmured subdued
approvals when, at last, the speaker took breath
and sat down, gazing solemnly around her with
dark, melancholy eyes very much blacked around
the lids.</p>

<p>Margaret then delivered a learned discourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
on &ldquo;Poise of Body and Poise of Mind,&rdquo; which
was skillfully expressed in such deep and intricate
language that nobody could understand what
she was talking about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very, very interesting, indeed,&rdquo; observed
Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remarkable; wonderful; so clearly put,&rdquo;
came from the others.</p>

<p>Minerva rubbed her eyes and frowned.</p>

<p>Nance recited &ldquo;The Raven,&rdquo; translated into
very bad French. This was almost more than
their gravity could endure, and when she ended
each verse with &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dit le corbeau: jamais plus</i>,&rdquo;
many of the girls stooped under the table for lost
handkerchiefs and Japanese napkins.</p>

<p>But it was not until Judy had sung a lullaby in
Sanskrit&mdash;so called&mdash;that Minerva became at all
suspicious. Even then it was the wrong kind of
suspicion. She thought that perhaps she should
have laughed, and the others had politely refrained
because she hadn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>After a great deal of learned talk, Molly stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
on a soap box and recited &ldquo;Curfew Shall Not
Ring To-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the crowning joy of that famous
evening, but still Minerva appeared seriously impressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recited that once at Mill Town High
School,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give us something to-night?&rdquo; asked
Molly kindly, feeling that in some way the unfortunate
Minerva ought to be allowed to join in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I ought to give another
poem by the same man,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;except that
Miss Oldham gave &lsquo;The Raven&rsquo; in French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell us you know &lsquo;The Bells&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded
Edith Williams, in a trembling whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I&rsquo;ve given it at lots of school entertainments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better turn down the lights,&rdquo; said
Margaret. &ldquo;The room should be in darkness
except the side light where Miss Higgins will
stand. That will be the spot light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a fortunate arrangement because,
while Minerva recited &ldquo;The Bells,&rdquo; with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
proper gestures, intonations and echoes, according
to Cleveland&rsquo;s recitation book, the girls silently
collapsed. When she had finished, they
were reduced to that exhausted state that arrives
after a supreme effort not to laugh.</p>

<p>At last the entertainment came to an end. Minerva
departed with some of the others, while
those who lived close by remained to chat for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give up,&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret Wakefield.
&ldquo;Minerva is beyond teaching. She must remain
forever the smartest girl in Mill Town High
School.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only pity of it is that it was all wasted on
one humorless person. We really furnished her
with a most delightful entertainment and she
never even guessed it,&rdquo; declared Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; remarked Molly. &ldquo;It
was cruel, I think. Suppose she had caught on?
Do you think it would have helped her? And we
would have been uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose she did understand and pretended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
not to. The joke would have been decidedly on
us,&rdquo; put in Katherine.</p>

<p>Later events of that evening would seem to
bear out this suggestion, although just how
deeply, if at all, Minerva was implicated in what
followed no one could possibly tell. It was a
question long afterwards in dispute whether one
person had managed the sequel to the Literary
Evening, or whether there had been a confederate.
Certainly it seemed that every imp in Bedlam
had been set free to do mischief, and if Minerva,
as arch-imp, was looking for revenge, she
found it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to appear inhospitable, girls, but
it&rsquo;s five minutes of ten and I think you&rsquo;d better
chase along,&rdquo; said Margaret Wakefield.</p>

<p>But when Judy laid hold of the knob and tried
to open the door, it would not budge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t open,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to
be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was to be done? They pulled and jerked
and endeavored to pry it open with a silver shoe
horn and a pair of scissors, and at last Jessie, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the smallest, was chosen to climb over the transom
and go for help. It was five minutes past
ten, and they prudently turned out the lights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me get at that knob just once before we
work the transom scheme,&rdquo; ejaculated Margaret,
who was very strong and athletic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People always think they can open tin cans
and doors and pull stoppers when other people
can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; observed Judy sarcastically.</p>

<p>Margaret treated this remark with contemptuous
indifference. Seizing the knob with both
hands, she turned it and, putting her knee to the
jamb, pulled with all her force. The arch fiend
on the other side must have turned the key at
this critical moment, for the door flew open and
the president tumbled back as if she had been
shot from a catapult, knocking a number of surprised
poets and authors into a tumbled heap.
They were all considerably bruised and battered,
and Margaret bit her tongue; a severe punishment
for one whose oratory was the pride of the
class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; whispered Jessie, who alone had escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the tumble, &ldquo;here comes the house matron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Softly she closed the door, and the girls waited
until the danger was over. Then Margaret hastened
to examine the keyhole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no key in it,&rdquo; she whispered, speaking
with difficulty, because her tongue was bleeding
from the marks of two teeth.</p>

<p>Whoever played the trick must have unlocked
the door, jerked the key out and fled the instant
the matron appeared at the end of the corridor.
There was no time to discuss the mystery, however.
She would be coming back in two minutes.
Again they waited in silence until they heard the
swish of her dress as she went past the door, now
left open a crack in order that Judy, lying flat
on her stomach on the floor, and enjoying herself
immensely, might be on the lookout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she hissed, as the large, rotund
figure of Mrs. Pelham was lost in the darkness,
and out they scuttled like a lot of mice loosed
from the trap.</p>

<p>But the evening&rsquo;s adventures were not over.</p>

<p>As Judy, in advance of Molly and Nance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
pushed open their door, already ajar, a small pail
of water, placed on the top of the door by the
arch-imp, whoever she was, fell on Judy&rsquo;s head
and deluged her. It contained hardly a quart
of water, but it might have been a gallon for the
wreck it made of Judy&rsquo;s clothes and the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;ll get even with somebody,&rdquo; exclaimed
that enraged young woman.</p>

<p>They turned on the green-shaded student&rsquo;s
lamp and drew the blinds, the night watchman
being very vigilant at the dormitories, and began
silently mopping up the floor with towels.</p>

<p>Judy removed her wet clothes, and unbound
her long hair, light in color and fine as silk in
quality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to bed,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;until I
find out what&rsquo;s happened to the Gemini,&rdquo; and
without another word she crept into the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance,&rdquo; whispered Molly, when they were
alone, &ldquo;if Minerva Higgins did this, she&rsquo;s about
the boldest freshman alive to-day. But, after all,
we can&rsquo;t exactly blame her, considering what we
did to her.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She is taking great chances,&rdquo; replied Nance,
who had a thorough respect for college etiquette
and class caste. &ldquo;Every pert freshman must be
prepared for a call-down; and if she doesn&rsquo;t take
it like a lamb, she&rsquo;ll just have to expect a freeze-out.
It&rsquo;s much better for her in the end. If
Minerva were allowed to keep this up for four
years, she would be entirely insufferable. She&rsquo;s
almost that now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think she could find it out without
such severe methods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Severe methods, indeed,&rdquo; answered Nance indignantly.
&ldquo;Do you call it severe to be asked
to sup with the brightest girls in Wellington?
Margaret&rsquo;s speech alone was worth all the humiliation
Minerva might have felt; but she didn&rsquo;t
feel any. Do you consider that rough, crude
jokes like this are going to be tolerated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know that Minerva played them,
yet,&rdquo; pleaded Molly. &ldquo;I do admit, though, that
it must have been a very ordinary person who
could think of them. Margaret might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
badly hurt if she hadn&rsquo;t fallen on top of the rest
of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently Judy came stalking into their bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I expected,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;The
Williamses&rsquo; bed was full of carpet tacks and
Mabel Hinton fell over a cord stretched across
her door and sprained her wrist. She has it
bound with arnica now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how Minerva could have had time
to do all those things,&rdquo; broke in Molly.</p>

<p>There are some rare and very just natures&mdash;and
Molly&rsquo;s was one of them&mdash;which will not be
convinced by circumstantial evidence alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would have had plenty of time,&rdquo; argued
Judy. &ldquo;It would hardly have taken five minutes
provided she had planned it all out beforehand.
Besides, it&rsquo;s easy for you to talk, Molly. You
didn&rsquo;t bite your tongue, or sprain your wrist, or
get a ducking; or undress in the dark and get
into a bedful of tacks. You escaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; came Nance&rsquo;s muffled voice
from the covers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is horrid,&rdquo; admitted Molly. &ldquo;Whoever did
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Minerva!&rdquo; broke in Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;must have a very mistaken idea of college
and the sorts of amusement that are customary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the argument ended for the night.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>VARIOUS HAPPENINGS.</small></h2>


<p>Guilty or innocent, Minerva Higgins displayed
an inscrutable face next day, and the juniors,
lacking all necessary evidence, were obliged to
admit themselves outwitted; but they let it be
known that jokes of that class were distinctly
foreign to Wellington notions, and woe be to
the author of them if her identity was ever disclosed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Molly was busy with many
things. As usual she was very hard up for
clothes, and was concocting a scheme in her
mind for saving up money enough to buy a new
dress for the Junior Prom. in February. She
bought a china pig in the village, large enough
to hold a good deal of small change, and from
time to time dropped silver through the slit in
his back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a safe bank,&rdquo; she observed to her
friends, &ldquo;because the only way you can get money
out of him is to smash him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pig came to assume a real personality in
the circle. For some unknown reason he had
been christened &ldquo;Martin Luther.&rdquo; The girls
used to shake him and guess the amount of
money he contained. Sometimes they wrote
jingles about him, and Judy invented a dialogue
between Martin Luther and herself which was
so amusing that its fame spread abroad and she
was invited to give it many times at spreads and
fudge parties.</p>

<p>The scheme that had been working in Molly&rsquo;s
mind for some weeks at last sprung into life as
an idea, and seizing a pencil and paper one day
she sketched out her notion of the plot of a short
story. It was not what she herself really cared
for, but what she considered might please the
editor who was to buy it as a complete story,
and the public who would read it. There were
mystery and love, beauty and riches in Molly&rsquo;s
first attempt. Then she began to write. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
it was slow work. The ideas would not flow as
they did for letters home and for class themes.
She found great difficulty in expressing herself.
Her conversations were stilted and the plot
would not hang together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought it would be so hard,&rdquo; she
said to herself when she had finished the tale
and copied it out on legal cap paper. &ldquo;And now
for the boldest act of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a triumphant flourish of the pen, she
rolled up the manuscript and marched across
the courtyard to the office of Professor Green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he called, quite gruffly, in answer
to her knock. But when she entered, he rose
politely and offered her a seat. Sitting down
again in his revolving desk chair, he looked at
her very hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you will think I have the most colossal
nerve,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;when you hear why I
have called; but I really need advice and you&rsquo;ve
been so kind&mdash;so interested, always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it this time?&rdquo; he interrupted kindly.
&ldquo;More money troubles?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly. Although, of course, I am
always anxious to earn money. Who isn&rsquo;t? But
I have a writing bee in my head. I&rsquo;ve had it ever
since last winter, although I confined myself
mostly to verse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly paused and blushed. She felt ashamed
to discuss her poor rhymes with this learned
man nearly a dozen years older than she was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no money in poetry,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;and I thought I would switch off to prose. I
have written a short story and&mdash;I hope you won&rsquo;t
be angry&mdash;I&rsquo;ve brought it over for you to look
at. I knew you looked over some of Judith&rsquo;s
stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I shan&rsquo;t be angry, child. I&rsquo;m glad
to help you, although I am not a fiction writer
and therefore might hardly be thought competent
to judge. Let&rsquo;s see what you have.&rdquo; He
held out his hand for the manuscript. &ldquo;On second
thought,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;suppose you read
it aloud to me. Girls&rsquo; handwriting is generally
much alike&mdash;hard to make out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, trembling with stage fright, her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
crimson, began to read. The professor, resting
his chin on his interlocked fingers, turned his
whimsical brown eyes full upon her and never
shifted his gaze once during the entire reading,
which lasted some twenty-five minutes. When
she had finished, Molly dropped the papers in her
lap and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it? Please don&rsquo;t
mince matters. Tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor came back to life with a start.
She knew at once that he had not heard a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, er&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Very
good. Very good, indeed. Suppose you leave
the manuscript with me. I&rsquo;ll look it over again
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose to go. After all she had no right to
complain, since she had asked this favor of a
very busy man; but she did wish he had paid
attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, Miss Brown, there was something
I wanted to say. What was it now?&rdquo; He
rubbed his head, and then thrust his hands into
his pockets. &ldquo;Oh, yes. This is what I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to say&mdash;have an apple?&rdquo; A flat Japanese basket
on the table was filled with apples. &ldquo;Excuse my
not passing the basket, but they roll over. Take
several. Help yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made Molly take three, one for Nance, one
for Judy and one for herself. Then he saw her
to the outer door, bowing silently, all the time
like a man in a dream.</p>

<p>The next morning the manuscript was returned
to Molly by the professor after the class
in Literature. It was folded into a big envelope
and contained a note. The note had no beginning
and was signed &ldquo;E.&nbsp;G.&rdquo; This is what it
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Since you wish my true opinion of this story,
I will tell you frankly that it is decidedly amateurish.
The style is heavy and labored and the
plot mawkishly sentimental and mock heroic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to think up some simple story and write
it out in simple language. Do not employ words
that you are not in the habit of using. Be natural
and express yourself as you would if you
were writing a letter to your mother. Write
about real people and real happenings; not about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
impossibly beautiful and rich goddesses and superbly
handsome, fearless gods. Such people
do not really exist, you know, and you are supposed
to be painting a word picture of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have talent, but you must be willing to
work very hard. Good writing does not come in
a day any more than good piano playing or painting.
I would add: be yourself&mdash;unaffected&mdash;sincere&mdash;and
your style will be perfect.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Molly wept a little over this frank expression
of criticism, although there did seem to be an
implied compliment in the last line. She reread
the story and blushed for her commonplaceness.
Surely there never had been written anything so
inane and silly.</p>

<p>For a long time she sat gazing at the white
peak of Fujiyama on the Japanese scroll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simple and natural, indeed,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much harder than the other way. Unaffected
and sincere! That&rsquo;s not easy, either.&rdquo; She
sighed and tore the story into little bits, casting
it into the waste-paper basket. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best
place for you,&rdquo; she continued, apostrophizing her
first attempt at fiction. &ldquo;Nobody would ever have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
laughed or cried over you. Nobody would even
have noticed you. My trouble is that I try too
hard. I am always straining my mind for words
and ideas. Now, when I write letters, how do
I do? I let go. I never worry. Can a story
be written in that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now, Mistress Molly,&rdquo; called Judy,
bursting into the room. &ldquo;Why are you lingering
here in the house when all the world&rsquo;s afield?
Get thee up and go hence with me unto the green
woods where we are to have tea, probably for
the last time before the winter&rsquo;s call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the usual crowd, and a few others from
Beta Phi House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll never have enough teacups to go
around, child,&rdquo; objected Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we shall. There are two other tea
baskets coming from Beta Phi. There will be
plenty and some over besides. Rosomond Chase
and Millicent Porter were so taken with my
basket last year that they each bought one. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
course Millicent&rsquo;s is much finer than mine or
Rosomond&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say. But I don&rsquo;t think I want to go,
Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth was Molly never felt in sympathy
with those two Beta Phi girls, who represented
an element in college she did not like. They
dressed a great deal, for one thing, especially
Millicent Porter, the girl who had sub-let Judith
Blount&rsquo;s apartment the year before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Molly, I think you&rsquo;re unkind,&rdquo; burst
out Judy. She never could endure even small
disappointments. &ldquo;They are awfully nice girls
and they want to know you better. They said
they did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t they come and see me?
That&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy did not reply. She was pulling down all
the clothes in the closet in a search for Molly&rsquo;s
tam and sweater. She was in one of her queer,
excited moods. Could it be that Judy thought
the sparkling coterie from Queen&rsquo;s was being
honored by these two rich young persons from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Beta Phi? Molly rejected the suspicion almost
as soon as it entered her mind. No, it was simply
that poor old Judy was obsessed with a desire
to get into the &ldquo;Shakespeareans,&rdquo; and by
courting the most influential members she
thought she could make it.</p>

<p>Molly pulled her slender length from the
depths of the Morris chair where she had been
lolling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said resignedly. &ldquo;I was
meditating on my ambitions when you broke in
on me. You are a very demoralizing young person,
Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy laughed. She made a charming picture
in her scarlet tam and sweater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and ambitions be
hanged.&rdquo; She seized her tea basket under one
arm and a box of ginger snaps under the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Judy, I am really shocked at you,&rdquo; exclaimed
Molly. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have to give you
another shaking up before long. You&rsquo;re getting
lax and lazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort. I only want to enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
life while the weather is good. It&rsquo;s lots easier
to think of ambitions on rainy days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other girls were waiting on the campus:
the Williamses, Margaret and Jessie, Nance and
presently the two Beta Phi girls. Rosomond
Chase was a plump, rather heavy blonde type,
always dressed to perfection and bright enough
when she felt inclined to exert her mind. Millicent
Porter was quite the opposite in appearance;
small, wiry, with a prominent, sharp-featured
face; prominent nose, prominent teeth and rather
bulging eyes. She talked a great deal in a highly
pompous tone, and her voice always slurred over
from one statement to another as if to ward off
interruption. She seemed much amused at this
little escapade in the woods, quite Bohemian and
informal.</p>

<p>The Queen&rsquo;s girls could hardly explain why she
appeared so patronizing. It was her manner
more than what she said; although Margaret insisted
that it was because she monopolized the
conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t go to listen to a monologue,&rdquo; Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
thundered later when they were discussing
the tea party. &ldquo;We came to hear ourselves talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What surprised Molly was the attention that
the young person of unlimited wealth bestowed
upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and sit beside me, Miss Brown, and tell
me about Kentucky,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t the gift of language,&rdquo;
replied Molly, without budging from her seat on
a log. &ldquo;Ask Margaret Wakefield. She&rsquo;s the
only conversationalist in the crowd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Mahomet must go to the mountain,
then,&rdquo; observed Miss Porter, and she moved graciously
over to the log, where she regaled Molly
with a great deal of wordy talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s going to do all the conversing, it
might as well be on something interesting,&rdquo;
thought Molly, and she started Millicent on the
topic of silver work. This young woman, rich
beyond calculation, had an unusual talent which
had not been neglected. She worked in silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her natural medium,&rdquo; Edith had observed
when she heard of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>She could beat out chains and necklaces, rings
of antique patterns, beautiful platters with enameled
centers with all the skill of a real silversmith.</p>

<p>Molly listened with polite interest to Millicent&rsquo;s
lengthy description of her art. There was
often an unconscious flattery in the sympathetic
attention Molly gave to other people&rsquo;s talk. It
had the effect of loosening tongues and brought
forth confidences and heart secrets. She was a
good listener and the repository of many a hidden
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only going to college, you know, to
please papa,&rdquo; Millicent was saying. &ldquo;He thinks
I should be finished off like a piece of statuary or
a new house. I would much rather do things
with my hands. I can&rsquo;t see how I am to be benefited
by all these classics. In the sort of life I
shall lead they won&rsquo;t do me any good. Society
people never quote Latin and Greek or make
learned references to early Roman history and
things of that sort. It isn&rsquo;t considered good
form. Modern novels are the only things people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
read nowadays, but papa is determined. Now,
with silver work, it&rsquo;s quite different. I love it.
I love to make beautiful things. I have just finished
a grape-vine chain. The workmanship is
exquisite. My sitting room is my studio, you
know, and I work there when I am not busy with
stupid books. You seem interested. Do you
know anything about silver work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly admitted her ignorance on the subject,
but Millicent did not pause to listen. Her voice
slurred over from the question to her next outburst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like beautiful rich colors. I intend to design
all the costumes for the next Shakespearean
performance. If I had been born in a different
sphere in life, I should have divided my time
between silver work and costuming. I can draw,
too, but it&rsquo;s more designing than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Millicent, encouraged by Molly&rsquo;s sympathetic
blue eyes, lowered her voice and plunged
into confidences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we were not so&mdash;er&mdash;well-to-do
two generations ago. My great-grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was an Italian silversmith. Isn&rsquo;t it
interesting? He was really an artist in his way,
and made wonderful vessels for the church, crucifixes,
and things like that. I tell mamma I believe
her grandfather&rsquo;s soul has entered into my
body. But that isn&rsquo;t all. Now, if I tell you this,
will you promise never to breathe it? It&rsquo;s really
a family secret, but it accounts for my love of
rich, beautiful things. I can sew, you know. I
adore to embroider. If I had to, I could easily
make all my own clothes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of,&rdquo; broke
in Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. That isn&rsquo;t the secret. The secret is
where I got the taste for such things. You promise
not to mention this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; replied Molly gravely, repressing
the smile that for an instant hovered on her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The silversmith grandfather had a brother
who was a merchant. He had a shop in Florence
where he sold all sorts of beautiful fabrics,
velvets and brocades and lots of antique things.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt it was an antique shop,&rdquo; thought
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma remembers it well, and the shop is
still there to-day, but it&rsquo;s in other hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly felt much amusement at this explanation
of heredity. It would not be difficult to add
a few lines to Millicent&rsquo;s small, thin face and
place it on the shoulders of the old silversmith
or of his brother, the dealer in antiques. How
would they feel if they could hear this granddaughter
conversing about society and the classics?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have rattled on. Here I have told you
two family secrets. But of course they will go
no farther. You know more about me than any
girl in Wellington. Won&rsquo;t you come over to
dinner with me Saturday evening and see my
studio?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;but I have an
engagement,&rdquo;&mdash;to try to write a sincere, natural,
simple short story, she added, in her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, what a nuisance! Can you come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Sunday? They have horrid early dinners Sunday,
but no matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was obliged to accept, anxious as she
was to keep out of the Beta Phi crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, do you act?&rdquo; asked Millicent
abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; answered Molly, and that ended the
tea party.</p>

<p>In the evening Judy was slightly cold to Molly.
It was almost imperceptible, so subtle was the
change, and Molly herself was hardly aware of
it until her friend, stretched on the couch reading,
suddenly closed her book with a snap and
remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Considering you dislike the Beta Phi girls,
you certainly managed to monopolize one of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy!&rdquo; remonstrated Nance, shocked at this
unaccountable exhibition of temperament.</p>

<p>Molly said nothing whatever, and presently
she slipped off to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got our faults,&rdquo; she kept saying to
herself, but she was bitterly hurt, nevertheless.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>&ldquo;THE BEST LAID SCHEMES.&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>Judy did have her failings, the faults of an
only child spoiled by indulgent parents. But they
were only on the surface, impulsive flashes of
irritability that never failed to be followed by
deep, poignant regret when the tempest had
passed.</p>

<p>The next morning Molly was wakened by the
fragrance of violets, and, opening her eyes, she
looked straight into the heart of a big bunch of
those flowers lying on her chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, I feel like a corpse,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Scrawled on a card pinned to the purple tissue
ribbon around the stems of the violets was the
following inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;For dearest Molly from her devoted and loving
Judy.&rdquo;</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor child must have got up early this
morning and gone down to the village for them,&rdquo;
she said to Nance. &ldquo;And she does hate getting
up early, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the coldness between the two girls came
to a temporary end. Molly did not go to the
Beta Phi House to dinner on Sunday. Millicent
sent word that she was ill with a headache and
would like to postpone the visit. Some of the
Shakespeareans came to the apartment of the
three girls to call one evening, but they were
Judy&rsquo;s friends, invited by her to drop in and have
fudge, and Molly and Nance kept quiet and remained
in the background. If Judy was working
to get into the Shakespeareans, she should
have the field to herself. The three visitors,
seniors all of them, left early, but in some mysterious
way the news of their call spread through
the Quadrangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which of you is boning for the &lsquo;Shakespeareans&rsquo;?&rdquo;
Minerva Higgins demanded of Nance
next day.</p>

<p>This irrepressible young person had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
acquired a smattering of college slang and college
gossip. But still she had not learned the
difference between a freshman and a junior.</p>

<p>Nance drew herself up haughtily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Higgins,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there are some
things at Wellington that are never discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Excuse me</em>,&rdquo; said Minerva, making an elaborate
bow.</p>

<p>But Nance did not even notice the bow. She
had gone on her way like an injured dignitary.</p>

<p>The air was certainly full of rumors, however.
Everybody, even the faculty, wondered upon
whose shoulders the Shakespeareans&rsquo; highly
coveted honors would fall. The new members
of this distinguished body were always chosen
after the junior play, preparations for which
were now under way. There had been first a
stormy meeting of the class. It was quite natural
for President Wakefield to want all her
particular friends to form the committee to
choose a play and select the actors, and it was
equally human of the Caroline Brinton forces to
resent the old clique rule. But Margaret was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
mighty leader and would brook no interference.
So the Queen&rsquo;s girls were the ruling spirits of the
entertainment. Judy was chairman of the committee,
and was to have the principal part in the
play, it being tacitly understood that she wanted
to show the Shakespeareans what she could do.</p>

<p>It was like the scholarly group to give a wide
berth to the modern comedies and melodramas
usually selected by juniors for this performance,
and to settle on &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can never do it,&rdquo; Caroline Brinton had
announced in great vexation. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t time
and we have no coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she had been calmly overruled and
&ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; it was to be, with daily rehearsals
except on Saturdays, when there were
two.</p>

<p>Molly was cast for the part of Maria, the maid.
And she was glad, chiefly because the costume
was easy. Judy was to play Viola, Edith Williams,
Malvolio, and the other parts were variously
distributed, Margaret being Sir Toby
Belch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>When a college girl reaches her junior year
her mind is well trained to concentrate and memorize.
Two years before, perhaps only Edith
Williams, whose memory was abnormal, would
have trusted herself to memorize a Shakespearean
part. But the girls were amazed now at
their own powers. Miss Pryor, teacher of elocution,
was present at many of the rehearsals,
criticizing and suggesting, and hers was the only
outside assistance the juniors had in their ambitious
production.</p>

<p>It was probably through her that the accounts
of their ability were noised abroad, and on the
night of the play there was a great rush for seats.
The president herself was there and many of the
faculty. Professor Green had a front balcony
seat looking straight down on the stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, but I&rsquo;m scared!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly,
peeping through the hole in the curtain at the
large assembly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven help us all,&rdquo; groaned Nance, dressed
as an attendant of the Duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; Judy admonished them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
&ldquo;We must make it go off all right. Molly, don&rsquo;t
you forget and be too solemn. Your part calls
for much merriment, as the notes in the book
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be so dictatorial,&rdquo; said Nance,
under her breath, hoping instantly that Judy, in
a high state of nerves and excitement, had not
heard her.</p>

<p>When the seniors began thumping on the floor
with their heels and the sophomores commenced
clapping, Molly&rsquo;s mind became a vacuum. Not
even the first line of her part could she recall.</p>

<p>At last the curtain went up and the play began.
She had no idea how Judy had conducted
herself. A girl near her said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She certainly had an awful case of stage
fright, but she&rsquo;ll be all right in the next act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words had no meaning to Molly, and she
sat like a frozen image in the wings until Nance
touched her on the shoulder and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she stepped into the glare of the footlights.
Her blood ceased entirely to circulate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Her hands became numb. Icy fingers seemed to
clutch her throat, and when she opened her mouth
to speak, no voice came. She remembered making
a fervent, speechless prayer.</p>

<p>In an instant her blood began to flow normally.
She felt a wave of crimson surge into her cheeks,
and she heard her own voice speaking to Margaret,
stuffed out with sofa cushions to resemble
Sir Toby Belch.</p>

<p>When the scene was over there was a great
clapping of hands. It sounded to Molly like a
sudden rainstorm in summer. And, like a summer
shower, it was refreshing to the young actors
in the great comedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work, Molly,&rdquo; Margaret whispered. &ldquo;I
think we carried that off pretty well. If only
Judy doesn&rsquo;t get scared again the thing will go
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Judy have stage fright?&rdquo; demanded
Molly, in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to say you didn&rsquo;t know? She almost
ruined the scene.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old Judy,&rdquo; thought Molly, &ldquo;and just
when she wanted to do her best, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy did improve considerably as the play progressed,
but even a friendly audience has an unrelenting
way of retaining first impressions; or
perhaps it was that poor Judy, sensitive and high
strung, imagined the audience was cold to her
and so allowed her spirit to be quenched. There
were no cries for &ldquo;Viola&rdquo; from the people in
front, and there were many for Malvolio, Sir
Toby and Maria.</p>

<p>Again and again these three actors came forth
and bowed their acknowledgment. During the
intermission several of the freshmen ushers carried
down bouquets of flowers. Jessie received
two from admirers who appeared to keep a running
account at the florist&rsquo;s in the village. A
splendid basket of red roses and a bunch of
violets were handed over the footlights for Molly,
and when she was summoned from the wings to
appear and receive these floral offerings she
flushed crimson and remarked to the usher:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be some mistake. They couldn&rsquo;t
be for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A ripple of laughter went over the entire
house. There was another burst of applause
which again brought Miss Molly Brown of Kentucky
into prominence through no fault of her
own.</p>

<p>The card on the magnificent basket of roses
made known to her the fact that Miss Millicent
Porter had thus honored her. The card on the
violets merely said: &ldquo;From a crusty old critic
who believes in your success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought Millicent Porter had a big crush on
you,&rdquo; observed Margaret later in the green room.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it now after this noble
tribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because she
has so much money and likes to spend it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On herself, yes, buying clothes and big lumps
of silver to play with; but not on you, Molly, dear,
unless she had been greatly taken with your
charms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly had seen a few college crushes and considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
them absurd, a kind of idol worship by
a young girl for an older one; but because she
had been so closely with her own small circle, she
had escaped a crush so far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much
too humble a person to be admired by such a
grand young lady. She sent the roses because
she had to recall her invitation to dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only time will prove it, Miss Molly,&rdquo; answered
Margaret.</p>

<p>The play ended with a grand storm of applause
and college yells. Not in their wildest dreams
had the juniors hoped for such success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to tell who was the best, they
were all so excellent,&rdquo; the president was reported
to have said.</p>

<p>Finally, to satisfy the persistent multitude,
each actor marched slowly in front of the curtain,
and each was received with more or less enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rah-rah-rah; rah-rah-rah; Wellington&mdash;Wellington&mdash;Margaret
Wakefield,&rdquo; they yelled; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Molly Brown? She&rsquo;s
all right. Molly&mdash;Molly&mdash;Molly Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the intoxicating excitement of this fifteen
minutes nobody realized that Judy had withdrawn
from the group of actors and hidden herself away
somewhere behind the scenery. There was some
speculation in the audience as to why Viola had
not filed across the stage with the others, but
since Judy&rsquo;s really devoted friends were all behind
the scenes, there was no one to bring her
out unless she chose to show herself with the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it simply grand?&rdquo; cried Jessie, the
last to taste the sweets of popularity. The hall
was still ringing with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jessie&mdash;Jessie&mdash;she&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; when she
bowed herself behind the curtain and joined her
classmates in the green room. Then there came
cries of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speech! Speech! Wakefield! Wakefield!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret, as composed as a May morning,
stepped to the front of the platform and gave
one of her most appropriate addresses to the joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the audience and the intense amusement of the
faculty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of that child, only eighteen, and making
such a speech! They are certainly a remarkable
group of girls. So much individuality
among them,&rdquo; said Miss Walker to Miss Pomeroy,
at her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And rare charm in some of the individuals,&rdquo;
added Miss Pomeroy. &ldquo;The little Brown girl,
for instance, who, by the way, is as tall as I am,
but so thin that she seems small, has magnetism
that will carry her through many a difficulty in
life. They tell me she is almost adored by her
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime the juniors, entirely unconscious
of these compliments from high places, and
perhaps it was quite as well they were, had just
missed Judy from their midst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she go before the curtain with the rest
of us?&rdquo; some one asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how strange, when she had the leading
part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard them give her the yell.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy, Judy,&rdquo; called Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; answered a muffled voice from
behind the scenery.</p>

<p>Presently Judy appeared, showing a face so
white and tragic that her friends were shocked.
With a tactful instinct most of the girls hurriedly
gathered their things together and disappeared,
leaving only the intimates in the green room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Judy, dearest, why did you hide yourself,
and you the leading lady of the company?&rdquo;
exclaimed Molly reproachfully, when all outsiders
had departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter me, Molly,&rdquo; Judy answered, in
a hard, strained voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you were,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;and you acted
beautifully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ruined the play,&rdquo; said Judy angrily. &ldquo;I
ruined the entire business, and you made me do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judy,&rdquo; cried Molly, &ldquo;you are talking
wildly. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did. You upset me completely when you
said: &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be so dictatorial.&rsquo; I never heard you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
make a speech like that before. And just as I
was about to go on, too. It was cruel. It was
unkind. If it had come from any one else but
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here,&rdquo; broke in Margaret. &ldquo;Really,
Judy, you&rsquo;re losing your temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never said it, anyhow,&rdquo; cried Nance. &ldquo;I
said it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did say it, Nance. You&rsquo;re just trying to
screen her,&rdquo; replied Judy, who had worked herself
into a nervous rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this going to be a free fight?&rdquo; asked Edith,
who always enjoyed battles.</p>

<p>Molly was gathering up her things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as far as I am concerned,&rdquo; she answered,
in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>As she went out she looked sorrowfully back
at Judy, but not another word did she say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself, Judy Kean?&rdquo;
cried Nance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re jealous and that&rsquo;s the
whole of it,&rdquo; and she flung herself out of the
door after Molly. The others quickly followed.
Certainly sympathy was against Judy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>And what of poor Judy left all alone in the
gymnasium?</p>

<p>Torn with anger, remorse, jealousy and disappointment,
she threw herself face downward
on the empty stage.</p>

<p>Presently the janitor came in and switched off
the lights.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE.</small></h2>


<p>Molly and Nance had little to say to each other
that night as they undressed for bed. Nance
was still filled with hot indignation over Judy&rsquo;s
&ldquo;falling-off&rdquo; as she called it, and Molly had no
heart for conversation. The door to Judy&rsquo;s bedroom
at the other end of the sitting room was
closed and they were not surprised when she did
not call &ldquo;good night&rdquo; as was her custom. Nobody
looked in on them. It was late and the
Quadrangle was soon perfectly still.</p>

<p>Under the sheets, her head buried in the pillows,
Molly cried a long time, softly and quietly,
like a steady downpour of rain. It seemed somehow
that her beloved friend, Judy, had died, and
that she was grieving for her. At last, worn
out, she fell asleep. It was a very heavy sleep.
She felt as if her arms were tied and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sinking down into space and, as is always the
case with dreams of falling, she waked with a
nervous leap as if her body had hit the bed and
rebounded. As she fell she had dreamed that she
heard a voice calling. Never mind what it said;
already the word, whatever it was, was a mere
pin point in her memory. It had flashed through
her mind like a shooting star across the sky. It
was brilliantly illuminating for the instant.
Molly was sure that it meant a great deal. It
was an important word, and it had an urgent
significance. For the tenth of a second her mind
had been wide awake, and now it was quite dark
again.</p>

<p>Molly leaped out of bed and began pulling on
her clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why am I dressing?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It is
because I must&mdash;<em>hurry!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; that was the word. It came back to
her now, quietly and significantly.</p>

<p>Nance wakened and sat up in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I must hurry. Don&rsquo;t stop
me,&rdquo; answered Molly.</p>

<p>Nance looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a nightmare, Molly,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Molly glanced up vaguely as Nance switched
on the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I? I don&rsquo;t know, but I must make
haste, or I&rsquo;ll be too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Molly. You&rsquo;re asleep. Nothing is
going to happen. You are here, in your own
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. I understand, but I must hurry.
Don&rsquo;t stop me, Nance. You may come if you
like, but don&rsquo;t stop me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance had often heard that it was dangerous
to awaken sleepwalkers too suddenly, and she
believed now as she saw Molly slipping on her
skirt and sweater that she was certainly asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearest Molly,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;This is college.
You are in your own room. It&rsquo;s a quarter
to twelve. Don&rsquo;t go out of the room.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly took no notice. Nance turned on another
light and slipped across to Judy&rsquo;s room.
She must have help, and Judy was the nearest
person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy&rsquo;s not in her room,&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly,
in a scared voice.</p>

<p>Molly gave a slight shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Judy who needs me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was
trying to remember. I couldn&rsquo;t make it out at
first. Put on your things, Nance. Don&rsquo;t delay.
Put out the light. We must hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance got into a few clothes as fast as she
could. She slipped on tennis shoes and an ulster
and presently the two girls were standing in the
corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going, Molly?&rdquo; asked Nance,
now under the spell of the other&rsquo;s conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; answered Molly, looking indeed
like a sleepwalker as she glided down the hall to
the main steps.</p>

<p>If the girls had glanced back they would have
noticed a figure creep softly after them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the gate is locked,&rdquo; objected Nance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, but we&rsquo;ll find another way. Come
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down the steps they hastened noiselessly. At
the bottom, instead of going straight ahead,
Molly turned to the left and led the way to a sitting
room for visitors on the ground floor of the
tower. The windows of the Tower Room, as it
was known, looked out on the campus. They
were small, deep-silled, and closed with iron-bound
wooden shutters like the doors into the
cloisters. Mounting a bench, Molly opened the
inside glass casement of one of the windows and
drew back the bolt which secured the shutter.
Then she hoisted herself onto the sill, crawled
through the window, and holding by both hands
dropped to the ground. Nance, of a more practical
temperament, wondered how they would
ever get back into the Tower Room; but blind,
unquestioning faith is an infinitely stronger staff
to lean upon than uneasy speculation, as Nance
was one day to find out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the night watchman makes his rounds,
will he see the window open in the tower?&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
thought. &ldquo;And if he does, what will he do?
Give the alarm at once or try to find out our
names and report us? If he reports us, what
then? We may be expelled, or suspended or
punished in some awful way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Nance&rsquo;s thoughts busily shaped out these
tragic events as she followed Molly out of the
window and dropped to the gravel walk below.
The tower clock struck twelve while the two girls
flitted across the campus. It was a strange adventure,
Nance pondered, and one she would
never have undertaken, or even considered, alone.
But then her instincts were not like Molly&rsquo;s. The
inner voice which spoke to her sometimes was
usually the sharp, reproving voice of a Puritan
conscience. It spoke to her now, but she turned
a deaf ear to it for once.</p>

<p>It told her how absurd she would appear to
other people in this dangerous midnight escapade;
what risks she was running. Judy, of
course, had spent the night with one of the other
girls, it said. It troubled her mind with whispers
of doubts and fears; it ridiculed and abused her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
but not once did it weaken her determination to
follow Molly wherever she intended to go. And
presently, when Molly quickened her footsteps
into a run, Nance kept right at her elbow like a
noonday shadow, foreshortened and broadened.</p>

<p>Molly turned in the direction of the lake.
Nance&rsquo;s heart gave a violent thump. She had
believed all along that they were taking a short
cut across to the gymnasium, instead of following
the gravel walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk now. Hurry,&rdquo; was Molly&rsquo;s brief
reply.</p>

<p>Across a corner of the golf course they flew,
and before Nance could take breath for another
dash through a fringe of pine trees she caught
sight of the waters, as black as ink. She clutched
Molly&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything?&rdquo; she asked, in a
frightened whisper.</p>

<p>They waited a moment, straining their ears in
the darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>From the middle of the lake came the sound of
a canoe paddle dipping into the water.</p>

<p>Molly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said, and they hastened
down to the platform of the boathouse.</p>

<p>In another moment they had launched a small
rowboat and were out on the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will Judy Kean never learn sense?&rdquo; Nance
thought impatiently. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just like a prairie
fire. It only takes a spark to set her going and
then she burns up everything in sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance had never been able to understand why
Judy could not hold her passionate, excitable
temperament more in control. She, herself, had
learned self-denial at an early age. But that was
because she had a selfish mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you ever guess she would be here,
Molly?&rdquo; she asked, as the prow of the boat cut
softly through the waters of the lake with a musical
ripple.</p>

<p>Nance was rowing, and Molly, who had never
learned to handle oars, was sitting facing her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t explain it. I dreamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that some one said &lsquo;hurry,&rsquo; and the lake seemed
to be the place to come to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some two hundred feet beyond they now made
out the silhouette of a canoe. Judy&mdash;of course it
was Judy; already they recognized the outline of
her slender figure&mdash;kneeling in the bottom of the
boat, had stopped paddling. She held up her
head like a startled animal when it scents danger.
It occurred to Nance, watching her over her
shoulder as they drew nearer, that there was
really something wild and untamed in Judy&rsquo;s
nature. She remembered that, the first morning
they had met her at Queen&rsquo;s, Judy had laughingly
announced that she had been born at sea on a
stormy night. But it was no joking matter,
Nance was thinking, and she fervently wished
that Judy would learn to quell her troubled
moods.</p>

<p>The next instant the two boats touched prows.
The little canoe, the most delicate and sensitive
craft that there is, quivered violently with the
shock of the collision and sprang back. As it
bounded forward again, Molly held out her hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Instinctively Judy grasped it, and the two boats
drew alongside each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crawl into our boat, Judy, dearest,&rdquo; said
Molly. &ldquo;It will be easier to pull the canoe to
shore if it&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy prepared silently to obey. But a canoe
is not a thing to be reckoned with at critical moments.
Just as Judy raised her foot to step into
the other boat, the treacherous little craft shot
from under her, and over she toppled, headforemost
into the waters. Fortunately, she was an
excellent swimmer, and the star diver of the
gymnasium pool. But the lake was not deep,
and when she came up, sputtering and puffing,
she found herself standing in water that was
only shoulder high.</p>

<p>Nance often thought, in looking back on this
painful episode, that nothing they could have
said to Judy would have brought her so completely
to her senses as this cold ducking. Certainly,
if Judy had actually planned to jump into
the lake, her wishes were most ludicrously carried
out, and the struggle she now made to climb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
back into the boat showed that she was not anxious
to stay any longer than she could help in the
icy bath. It was a sight for laughter more than
for tears, sensible Nance pondered with a slight
feeling of contempt&mdash;that of Judy, struggling
and kicking to draw herself into the boat. Indeed,
she almost managed to upset them, too;
but she did tumble in somehow, shivering and
wet but extremely contrite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know I was out here?&rdquo; was the
first question she put, when, having seized the
rope on the prow of the canoe, they headed for
shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I only guessed,&rdquo; answered
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was up and dressed before she even knew
you were not in your room,&rdquo; announced Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a fool,&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, &ldquo;and I know
now what good friends you are to have come for
me. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I intended to do
out here,&rdquo; she went on brokenly. &ldquo;I felt ashamed
to face any one, even mamma and papa. I
might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off, shivering. Rivulets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of water were pouring from her wet clothing
into the bottom of the boat. She still wore the
costume she had worn in the last scene of the
play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you my ulster as soon as we land,
Judy,&rdquo; said Nance, rowing with long rapid
strokes which sent the boat skimming over the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a low-down worthless dog,&rdquo; went on
Judy, taking no notice of Nance&rsquo;s interruption.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no good trying to apologize, Molly.
Words don&rsquo;t mean anything. But when the
chance comes&mdash;and the chance always does come
if you want it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be able to show you how
sorry I am for what I did, and how much I really
love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You showed me what a real friend you were
last winter, Judy,&rdquo; broke in Molly, &ldquo;when you
gave up your room at Queen&rsquo;s for my sake. I
wasn&rsquo;t angry about what happened at the gym.
I was hurt of course because I&rsquo;m a sensitive
plant, but I knew it would be all right in the end
because we are too close to each other now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
let a few hasty words come between us. But
here we are at the boat landing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having tied the two boats in the boat house,
which was never kept locked, they hurried back
to college. Nance insisted upon Judy&rsquo;s putting
on her ulster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m never cold,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You girls will just kill me with kindness,&rdquo; exclaimed
Judy humbly.</p>

<p>But Nance did not even hear this abject
speech. The question of how they were to get
back into the Quadrangle was occupying her
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking an awful risk,&rdquo; she observed to
Molly, in a low voice. &ldquo;There is no other way
but the window, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any other way,&rdquo; answered
Molly, &ldquo;unless we ring the bell over the gate and
alarm the entire dormitory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose the night watchman has closed the
window? What then?&rdquo; demanded Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll just have to find some other way,
then,&rdquo; answered her optimistic friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>But the window in the Tower Room was wide
open, just as they had left it.</p>

<p>The doubting Nance still had another theory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose the night watchman has left it open
on purpose to catch us when we come back?&rdquo; she
suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish you would stop hunting up troubles,
Nance,&rdquo; ejaculated Molly irritably. &ldquo;I never
found supposing did any good, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance, thus rebuked, said nothing more.</p>

<p>Molly, boosted by the other girls, pulled herself
onto the window sill and climbed into the
room. She looked about her cautiously. But
Nance&rsquo;s fears were groundless so far. The
room was perfectly empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let down a chair,&rdquo; whispered Judy.</p>

<p>There were no small chairs about, however,
and she was obliged to choose a bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are we to get it back again?&rdquo; she asked,
after Nance had clambered in, and Judy, halfway
through, paused to consider this question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry, the watchman,&rdquo; hissed Nance, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lookout at the door. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming down the
side corridor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next instant Judy had leaped into the
room, and the three girls were tearing along the
hall and up the steps, Judy leaving a trail of
water behind her. The watchman had seen
them. They could hear the beat of his steps on
the cement floor as he ran. The fugitives
reached the upper corridor just as he arrived at
the first landing on the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kick off your pumps, Judy, and pick up your
skirts. He&rsquo;ll trace us by the wet trail if you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another dash and they were in their sitting
room, the door locked behind them. Oh, blessed
relief!</p>

<p>Judy, in her stocking feet, was holding up her
skirts with both hands. Nance had seized one
of the slippers and she thought that Molly had
the other.</p>

<p>But the final excitement of that eventful night
was veiled in mystery.</p>

<p>As they had burst into their sitting room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
some one ran swiftly across the room, through
the passage into Judy&rsquo;s room and into the corridor.
They dared not follow and run the risk
of meeting the night watchman, probably standing
at that moment at the end of the corridor
trying to trace that path of water, which, thanks
be to Nance&rsquo;s prudence, ended there and was lost
on the green strip of carpet.</p>

<p>Below in the Tower Room the windows of the
casement flapped back and forth in the wind
which was rising steadily, and on the path below
stood that telltale bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only one person
who knows we were out to-night and, whoever
she is, she can&rsquo;t tell without giving herself
away.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>COVERING THEIR TRACKS.</small></h2>


<p>When the dressing bell rang next morning,
three heavy-eyed and extremely weary young
women felt obliged to pull themselves together
and appear at the breakfast table. Judy had
caught cold, and to disguise this condition had
plastered pink powder on her nose, and now held
her breath almost to suffocation to avoid coughing
in public.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo; demanded Jessie,
hurrying in late and sitting next to Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no. What is it?&rdquo; asked Nance calmly.</p>

<p>Molly felt the color rising in her cheeks, and
Judy buried her snuffles in a long letter from her
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the greatest tale going around the
Quadrangle! Everybody is talking about it,&rdquo;
continued Jessie. &ldquo;One of the chambermaids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
started it, I think, because she told it to me just
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Edith Williams impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the Quadrangle girls were out last
night gallivanting. They climbed through the
Tower Room window, left a bench outside and
the window open. I suppose the watchman
frightened them before they could hide all
traces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a wild freak,&rdquo; commented
Katherine. &ldquo;What do you suppose they were
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They might have been doing lots of things,&rdquo;
replied Jessie mysteriously. &ldquo;The maid said the
watchman thought they had been driving or motoring
with some Exmoor boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; ejaculated a sophomore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
for them if they are found out. I happen to
know Prexy&rsquo;s feelings about escapades like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Were you ever caught?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Don&rsquo;t you see me sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
here at the table? But my older sister was in
the class with a girl who was caught. She was
a campus girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to her?&rdquo; demanded Judy, forgetting
her cold in the interest of the story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bounced,&rdquo; answered the sophomore briefly.</p>

<p>The Williamses and Jessie looked at Judy with
mixed feelings of surprise; not because they noticed
her cold or regarded it with any suspicion,
but because, when they had parted company with
her the night before she had been in the throes of
a jealous rage and had spoken most insultingly
to her best friend. Their glances shifted to
Molly. The two girls were seated side by side.
Judy was leaning affectionately against Molly&rsquo;s
shoulder while they looked together at a picture
post card sent by Mary Stewart from France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All bets are off,&rdquo; whispered Edith to her sister.
&ldquo;They have made it up. Molly is an angel
of forgiveness. We were wrong for once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Margaret was correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pound of Mexican kisses and two pounds
of mixed chocolates,&rdquo; said Margaret in Edith&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
other ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve won my bet, I hope you&rsquo;ll take
notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just taking notice,&rdquo; answered Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s some more of the story,&rdquo; piped
out Jessie again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to hear the
most exciting part?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens, yes. Did they catch them?&rdquo; asked
several voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, but one of the girls was wet,&rdquo; announced
Jessie impressively. &ldquo;She left a trail
of water after her all the way up the steps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think they could have traced her by
that,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They could have if she had kept on trailing,
but she must have remembered and held up her
skirt, for it stopped right there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wise lady,&rdquo; put in Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have been canoeing and not driving,
then,&rdquo; observed Margaret. &ldquo;Else why the
significant fact of wet clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice night to go canoeing in, cold and dark.
Strange notion of pleasure,&rdquo; remarked Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s more still to come,&rdquo; announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Jessie, when they had finished commenting on
this remarkable escapade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Jessie, you&rsquo;re like a serial
story of adventure&mdash;a thriller in every chapter.
What now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jessie, &ldquo;you may well prepare for
a thriller this time. The watchman found something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? What?&rdquo; they cried, and Nance, Judy
and Molly joined in the chorus with as much excitement
as any of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He found a slipper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy made an enormous effort to keep her hand
from trembling, as she raised her coffee cup to
her dry, feverish lips. Molly, as usual under excitement,
changed from white to red and red to
white. Nance alone seemed perfectly calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they can prove anything by
that,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;There are probably fifty
girls or even a hundred who wear the same size
shoes here. Molly is the only girl I know of
who wears a peculiar size, six and a half triple
A.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, &lsquo;one thing is certain and the rest is
lies,&rsquo; as old Omar remarked,&rdquo; said Margaret,
rising from the table, &ldquo;and that is, all juniors
can prove an alibi last night. No junior would
ever go gallivanting on the night of the junior
play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; answered Nance, who had risen to
the occasion with fine spirit and tact. Molly&rsquo;s
face resumed its normal color and Judy looked
relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing they will have to do,&rdquo; said Edith,
&ldquo;is to find the other slipper. And if the owner
of that slipper takes my advice she&rsquo;ll drop it down
the deepest well in Wellington County.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly and Nance and Judy hurried through
breakfast and rushed back to their apartment.
They locked all the doors carefully and gathered
in Judy&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have nearly fifteen minutes before
chapel,&rdquo; said Nance, speaking rapidly. &ldquo;Judy,
are your things dry? Get them quickly. They
may search our rooms. Miss Walker is pretty
determined once she&rsquo;s roused, I hear.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Judy gathered up the stiff, rough-dry garments
that had been hanging on the heater all night,
while Molly found tossed in a corner the mate
to the fatal slipper. Judy held up Viola&rsquo;s dress
of old rose velvet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ruined,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s another
complication. Suppose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; interrupted Molly hastily,
snatching the dress away from her. &ldquo;Hurry,
Nance, where shall we put them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a temporary safe hiding place they chose
the interior of the upright piano. Then they
hastily made their beds, set their dressing tables
to rights and dashed off to chapel just as the
matron appeared on an ostensible tour of inspection.</p>

<p>It was possible that she was not being very
vigilant with the juniors, however, that particular
morning, knowing that they were one and all
engaged in producing a very important play the
night before. At any rate, she only glanced
casually around, saw nothing incriminating and
departed to the next room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The president looked grave and worried at
chapel, but, contrary to expectations, she had
nothing to say after the prayer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad sign,&rdquo; observed a student. &ldquo;When
Prexy doesn&rsquo;t say anything, she means business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Except for a few moments at lunch, the three
girls did not meet in private consultation again
until late in the afternoon. There was a busy
sign on their study door. Molly smiled knowingly
to herself, and gave the masonic tap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and will keep
out inquisitive people until we decide what to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She found Judy stretched on the sofa, feverish
and coughing, while Nance was dosing her with
a large dose of quinine and an additional dose of
sweet spirits of niter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to kill me, Nance,&rdquo; Judy was
grumbling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, be quiet,&rdquo; scolded Nance.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any voice to waste. Molly, will
you make her a hot lemonade? I think we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
better get her to bed and cover her up with all
the comforts so as to bring on a perspiration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one?&rdquo; inquired Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up from there and go to bed,&rdquo; ordered
Nance. &ldquo;The inspection is over and there won&rsquo;t
be any chance of another one to-day. You&rsquo;ll
have to miss supper to-night. We&rsquo;ll say you have
one of your sick headaches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy obediently got out of her things while
Molly flew around making hot lemonade, and
Nance hung a blanket over the heater and pulled
down their three winter comforts off a shelf in
the closet.</p>

<p>Judy meekly allowed herself to be smothered
under a mountain of covers, while she drank the
lemonade with childish enjoyment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always make good ones, Molly, darling,
because you put in enough sugar. I&rsquo;ll probably
be melted into a fountain of perspiration like
Undine, only she went away in tears,&rdquo; she complained
presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the object of the treatment,&rdquo; answered
Nance sternly. &ldquo;Whatever is left of you after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the melting process is over is quite well of the
cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly could have laughed if she had not been
thinking of something else very hard.</p>

<p>The two girls sat down on the divan and began
a subdued and earnest conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we to do with these things, Molly?
We can&rsquo;t leave them in the piano because the
moment some one sits down to play we&rsquo;ll be discovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murderers take up the planks in the floor and
hide their bloodstained clothing underneath,&rdquo; observed
Molly. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t do that, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They took the bundle from its hiding place and
looked over the garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; announced Nance, who had
many practical notions on the subject of clothes.
&ldquo;Suppose we take the dress to the cleaner&rsquo;s in
the village and have it steamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we steam it ourselves over the tea
kettle?&rdquo; demanded Molly. &ldquo;We can and we&rsquo;ll
do it right now and press it on the wrong side.
If it hadn&rsquo;t been so much admired, it wouldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
matter so very much, but some one&rsquo;s sure to ask
to see it or borrow it or something. How about
the underclothes? Can&rsquo;t we smooth them out
with a hot iron before they go to the laundry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They set to work at once to heat water and
irons, and presently were engaged in restoring
the old rose velvet to a semblance of its former
beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do about that slipper?&rdquo;
demanded Molly, pausing in her labors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to that,&rdquo; replied Nance.
&ldquo;We must bury it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE GRAVE DIGGERS.</small></h2>


<p>Three times during the night Molly and Nance
crept into Judy&rsquo;s room and looked at her anxiously.
She seemed to be sleeping heavily, but
she tossed about the bed with feverish restlessness,
and her forehead was burning hot.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the faithful friends were
up again, tipping about like two wraiths of the
dawn in their trailing dressing gowns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bathe her face and hands before she takes
any tea,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s awake. I saw her
open her eyes when I peeped in just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy was awake and sitting bolt upright when
they presently entered with the basin and towels.
There was a strange look in her eyes. Molly
remembered to have seen it before when Judy was
in the grip of the wander thirst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Sweet Spirits of Niter,&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
cried, in a hoarse, excited voice. &ldquo;Knowst thou
the land of Sweet Spirits of Niter?&rdquo; she began
singing. &ldquo;Knowst thou the Sweet Spirits? They
are tall, slender, gray ladies done in long curving
lines, like that.&rdquo; She illustrated her ideas of
these strange beings by sketching a picture on an
imaginary canvas. &ldquo;They lean against slim
trees. They have soft musical voices and speak
gently because they are sweet. You see? And
the Land of Niter, what of it? It is a land of
gray mists, always in twilight, and the Sweet
Spirits who live in it are shadows. It is a sad
land, but it is still and quiet and there are cool
fountains everywhere. Sweet spirit, wouldst
give me to drink of thy cup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly and Nance laughed. They knew that
Judy was delirious, but it was impossible not to
laugh over her strange, poetic illusion regarding
sweet spirits of niter. Setting down the basin
and towel, they retreated to the next room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better make her a cup of beef tea as
quickly as we can,&rdquo; said Nance. &ldquo;That will
quench her thirst and nourish her at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
time. Good heavens, Molly, what shall we do if
she begins to talk about the slipper and the lake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Molly, lighting the
alcohol lamp, while Nance found the jar of beef
extract. &ldquo;I wish you hadn&rsquo;t given her so much
physic, Nance.&rdquo; Molly had a deep-rooted objection
to medicine, while Nance, on the other
hand, was a firm believer in old-fashioned remedies.
&ldquo;Her stomach was in no condition for all
that stuff. It was utterly upset. Her gastric
juices had been lashed into a storm and hadn&rsquo;t
had time to subside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance smiled at Molly&rsquo;s ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are getting the emotions and the stomach
mixed, Molly, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Molly had her own ideas on this subject,
but it was vain to argue with her friend, the
actual proprietor of a real medicine chest marked
&ldquo;Household Remedies,&rdquo; which contained more
than a dozen phials of physics.</p>

<p>Judy was, in fact, paying the penalty for her
mental storm when on the night of the play she
had run through the whole scale of emotions, beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with stage fright and an awful fear and
passing into mortification, disappointment, rage,
remorse and finally sorrow, or it might be called
self-pity, which inspired her to launch a canoe
and paddle into the middle of the lake at midnight.
It will never be known how near she
came to jumping into the lake. It is difficult to
reckon with an unrestrained, hypersensitive nature
like hers, always up in the heights or down
in the depths; sometimes capable of splendid
acts of generosity and unselfishness, but capable
also of inflicting cruel punishments for imagined
offences.</p>

<p>Nance was for more medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I give her a big dose of castor oil,
Molly,&rdquo; she suggested, while she stirred the tea.
&ldquo;She had better take it before she drinks this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, Nance, you&rsquo;ll kill her,&rdquo; exclaimed
Molly, horrified. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that it is entirely
a mental thing with Judy? What she needs
is absolute quiet, and the quinine has probably
excited her and made her delirious. She doesn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
need things to stimulate her. She&rsquo;s almost effervescent
in her normal condition, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Castor oil isn&rsquo;t a stimulant, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but she&rsquo;d better not be upset
any more,&rdquo; and in the end Molly had her way.</p>

<p>Returning in a few moments to bathe Judy&rsquo;s
face, she found the sick girl half out of bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back into bed, Judy,&rdquo; she said firmly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to have a nice quiet day in here and no
one to bother you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the slipper. I&rsquo;m looking for the other
slipper,&rdquo; began Judy, weeping. &ldquo;Oh, dear, I
must find the slipper. Nance, Molly, the slipper,
have you seen the slipper, the old oaken slipper,
the iron-bound slipper that hangs in the well. If
it&rsquo;s in the well now, drop it to the bottom. I hope
it&rsquo;s a deep well, the deepest well in Well County.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was unkind to laugh, but Molly could not
keep her countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have known,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;that
Judy could be more delirious than anybody in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy submitted to having her face bathed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
drank the beef tea without a murmur. She appeared
greatly refreshed and quieted and said a
few rational words about having had bad dreams.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning, frosty and bright.
The bell of the Catholic Church in the village
called devotees to early mass. It rang out joyfully
and persuasively, reiterating its message to
unbelievers. It was a cheerful sound and, in
spite of Judy&rsquo;s troubles, they felt comforted.
The steam heat began its pleasant matins in the
pipes. The kettle on the alcohol stove hummed
busily. Molly began to make preparations for
breakfast. Although she was not self-indulgent,
discomfort was never an acceptable state to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get your bath, Nance,&rdquo; she ordered, &ldquo;and
then you can come back and make the toast while
I take mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance departed for the bathrooms with soap
and towels, while Molly busied herself spreading
a lunch cloth on one of the study tables and
placing a blue china bowl full of oranges in the
center. Then she carefully extracted four eggs
from a paper bag in a box on the outer window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
ledge; cut four thin, even slices of bread to be
inserted in Judy&rsquo;s patent electric toaster, and at
intervals poured boiling water through the dripper
into the coffee pot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were at home this morning,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
would be eating hot waffles and kidney hash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly she looked up. Judy was standing
in the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want my slipper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly took her hand and gently led her back
to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy, would you like a cup of delicious,
strong, hot coffee?&rdquo; she asked, endeavoring to divert
Judy&rsquo;s quinine-charged senses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much, but the slipper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Judy began
to whimper like a child.</p>

<p>Molly hurried into the next room, found one of
Nance&rsquo;s slippers and gravely handed it to Judy,
who grasped it carefully with both hands as if
it were something very precious and brittle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I gave her your slipper, Nance, I felt
something like the old witch who had kidnapped
the Queen&rsquo;s infant and put a changeling in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
place,&rdquo; Molly observed later, in telling about this
incident to Nance. &ldquo;But there is nothing to do
but humor her, I suppose, until the influence of
the quinine wears off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where has she got it now?&rdquo; asked Nance,
ignoring Molly&rsquo;s allusions to quinine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? The changeling slipper? Under her
pillow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking, Molly,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that
to-day would be an excellent time to get rid of
that other slipper. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I could sleep
comfortably another night in these rooms with
the guilty thing around. Until we dig a hole and
bury it deep, we shall never have any peace of
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was carefully peeling the shell from the
end of an egg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could leave her alone this
afternoon?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;How long does quinine
continue its ravages?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not long,&rdquo; answered Nance, in a most
matter of fact voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s such a sensitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
subject, that is the trouble. Quinine doesn&rsquo;t usually
make people take on so. I never met any
one so excitable and high strung as Judy. She
gets her nerves tuned up to such a high pitch
sometimes that I wonder they don&rsquo;t snap in two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance, don&rsquo;t you think we ought to confess
the whole thing to Miss Walker?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think Judy would ever forgive us if
we did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Confessing
would involve so much. We would have to go
back so far to the original cause, those wretched
Shakespeareans. It would be pretty hard on poor
old Judy. But the slipper, Nance&mdash;it&rsquo;s such a
ridiculous thing, our hiding that slipper. Where
shall we hide it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must dig a grave and bury it,&rdquo; said
Nance, &ldquo;and we must do it this afternoon and
get the thing off our minds. Then all evidence
will be destroyed and there will be no possible
way of finding out about Judy.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have forgotten about the visitor to our
room in the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Nance, &ldquo;there is that visitor.
Who was she? What did she want? You
haven&rsquo;t missed anything, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Molly. &ldquo;I have nothing valuable
enough to steal except old Martin Luther,
and he&rsquo;s quite safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reached for the china pig on the bookshelves
and shook him carefully. His interior
gave out a musical jingle.</p>

<p>Clothed and fed and comforted, the two girls
leaned back in their Morris chairs, with extra
cups of coffee resting on the chair arms, to consider
the question of Judy&rsquo;s slipper. At last they
came to a mutual agreement.</p>

<p>Otoyo, the safest, discreetest and least inquisitive
of their friends, was to be taken partly into
their confidence and left to look after Judy while
they went on their mysterious errand. Otoyo,
who had the racial peculiarity of the Japanese of
never being surprised at anything, accepted this
position of trust without a comment. Few students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
took Sunday morning walks at Wellington,
and therefore morning was the safest time for
the expedition. Judy, reënforced with a soft-boiled
egg and a cup of coffee, appeared perfectly
rational and quiet. She surrendered the
slipper without a murmur, and turning over on
her side dropped off to sleep. A Not-at-Home
sign was hung on the door and Otoyo was cautioned
not to let any one into Judy&rsquo;s room. She
was to say to all callers that Judy had a headache
and was asleep.</p>

<p>Dressed for a tramp, with Judy&rsquo;s slipper in
one of the deep pockets of Nance&rsquo;s ulster, and a
knife, fork and table spoon for digging purposes
in the other, the two girls presently left Otoyo
on the floor immersed in study. They had
scarcely closed the door when Judy called from
the next room:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me that slipper, Otoyo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the little Japanese, with a puzzled look on
her face, obeyed.</p>

<p>As they hastened down the corridor, hoping
devoutly not to meet intimate friends, Molly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Nance were stopped by the irrepressible Minerva
Higgins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a stroke of luck?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;You are going for a walk and so am I. I was
just on the lookout for somebody. Girls here
are so industrious Sunday mornings, I can never
get any one to go walking until afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was silent. At that moment she yearned
for the courage of Nance, who with a word could
scatter Minerva&rsquo;s cheeky assurance like chaff
before the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lack of character, I suppose,&rdquo; she thought
disconsolately. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t crush a fly, much
less that presumptuous little freshman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood back, therefore, and let Nance have
a clear field for the struggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind to offer us your company,
Miss Higgins, but we must beg to be excused to-day,&rdquo;
said Nance calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call that a nice, Sunday-morning, Christian
spirit,&rdquo; cried Minerva, with an angry flash in
her small, pig-like eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Minerva,&rdquo; put in Molly gently. &ldquo;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
must not think that way about it. Nance and I
have some important business to discuss, that&rsquo;s
all. You mustn&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;s unkind when older
girls turn you down sometimes. You know it
isn&rsquo;t customary here for a freshman to invite
herself to join an older girl. I believe it isn&rsquo;t
customary in any college. Don&rsquo;t be angry,
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hidden under layers of vanity, selfishness and
stupid assurance, was Minerva&rsquo;s better self
which Molly hoped to reach, and some day she
would break through the crust, but not this
morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me anything about upper-class girls&mdash;conceited
snobs! I know all about them,&rdquo; exclaimed
Minerva angrily, as she marched down
the corridor in a high state of rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about her. She&rsquo;s a hopeless
case, just as Margaret said,&rdquo; remarked Nance.</p>

<p>Once off the campus, they followed the path
along the lake and turned their faces toward
Round Head as being the spot most apt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
deserted at that hour in the morning. It was not
long before they were climbing the steep hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall we lay it to rest, poor weary little
<em>sole?&rdquo;</em> asked Nance, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s dig the grave on the Exmoor side,&rdquo; answered
Molly. &ldquo;Behind one of those big rocks
is a good spot. We&rsquo;ll be hidden from sight and
the ground is softer there.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="molly002" id="molly002"></a>
<img src="images/molly002.jpg" width="400" height="588" alt="THEY SET TO WORK TO DIG A SMALL GRAVE FOR JUDY&rsquo;S SLIPPER.&mdash;Page&nbsp;129." title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">THEY SET TO WORK TO DIG A SMALL GRAVE FOR JUDY&rsquo;S SLIPPER.&mdash;<i>Page&nbsp;129.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Talking and giggling, because after all they
were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing, they
set to work to dig a small grave for Judy&rsquo;s slipper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the earth casts up its dead on the Day
of Judgment, Nance, do you suppose this slipper
will seek its mate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t seek it any sooner,&rdquo; answered
Nance dryly.</p>

<p>At last the grave was ready. They laid the
slipper in the hole, carefully covered it with
earth, and concealed all evidences of recent disturbance
with bits of grass and splinters of
rock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Molly, leaning against the side of the
boulder and clasping her hands, remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let this be its epitaph:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Under the wide and starry sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dig the grave and let me lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad did I live and gladly die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I laid me down with a will.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;This be the verse you &rsquo;grave for me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here he lies where he longed to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home is the sailor, home from the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hunter home from the hill.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Scarcely had the last words died on her lips
when Nance gave a low, horrified exclamation.
Molly glanced up quickly. Just above them in
the shadow of another big rock stood Professor
Green in his old gray suit. So still was he that
he might have been a part of the geological formation
of the hill, planted there centuries ago.
Molly felt the hot blood mount to her face. How
long had he been there? How much had he
seen? What did he think? Forcing its way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
through all these wild speculations came another
thought: there was a brown coffee stain on one
of his trouser legs. She tried to speak, but the
words refused to come, and before she could get
herself in hand, the professor coldly lifted his
hat and walked away.</p>

<p>In his glance she read <small>DISAPPOINTMENT</small> as
plainly as if it had been written across his brow
in letters of fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nance,&rdquo; she cried, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t tell, even if he has seen,&rdquo; Nance
reassured her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind, Molly, dear. Come
along. I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that! It&rsquo;s not that!&rdquo; sobbed Molly.
But then, of course, Nance wouldn&rsquo;t understand
what it really was, because she hardly understood
it herself. He believed, of course, that she
had gone rowing with some Exmoor boys after
ten o&rsquo;clock. He had heard the story of the slipper.
Everybody had heard it. It was the talk
of college. For a moment Molly felt a wave of
resentment against Judy. Then her anger
shifted to Professor Green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;At least he might have given us a chance to
explain,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she followed Nance
along the lake path back to the campus.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered the room, a little while
later, they saw by Otoyo&rsquo;s face that something
had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; they demanded uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; ejaculated Otoyo, raising both hands
with an eloquent gesture, &ldquo;it was that terrible
Mees Heegins. You had but scarcely departing
gone when there came to the door a rap-rap-rap&mdash;so.
I thought it was you returning, and when
I open, she push her way in, so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otoyo gave an imitation of Minerva forcing
her way into the sitting room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She say: &lsquo;I wish to see Mees Kean on a particular
business.&rsquo; I say: &lsquo;Mees Kean has a sickness
to her head.&rsquo; She say: &lsquo;Move away, little
yellow peril. Don&rsquo;t interfere with me. I wish
to inquire after her health.&rsquo; Then she make
great endeavors to remove me from the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you do, Otoyo?&rdquo; they asked
anxiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Otoyo&rsquo;s face took on an expression half humorous
and half deprecating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not make you angry with little Japanese
girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I employ jiu jitsu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls both laughed, and Otoyo, relieved,
joined in the merriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She receive no bruises, but she receive a
shock, because it arrive so suddenlee, you see?
So she quietlee walk away and say no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You adorable little Japanese girl,&rdquo; cried
Molly, embracing her.</p>

<p>Nance opened the door and peeped into Judy&rsquo;s
room.</p>

<p>She was sleeping quietly, the slipper clasped in
both hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>A VISIT OF STATE.</small></h2>


<p>Judy still slept the sleep of the exhausted.
Her tired forces craved a long rest after the
storm that had lashed and beaten them. The
girls crept about the room softly and spoke in
low voices, and when they went down to the
early dinner locked the door and took the key
with them. Later, fearing callers, again they
hung out a Busy sign and settled themselves
comfortably for a peaceful afternoon. Nance,
armed with a dictionary and notebook, was translating
&ldquo;Les Misérables,&rdquo; a penitential task she
had set for herself for two hours every Sunday.</p>

<p>Molly was also engaged in a penitential task.
She was endeavoring to compose a story on simple
and natural lines. It was very difficult. Her
mind at this moment seemed to be an avenue for
bands of roving and irrelevant thoughts and refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to concentrate on the work at hand. She
made several beginnings, as: &ldquo;One blustering,
windy day in March a lonely little figure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
With a contemptuous stroke of her pencil, she
drew a line through the words and wrote underneath:
&ldquo;It was a calm, beautiful morning in
May&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twirling her pencil, she paused to consider
this statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, that won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
entirely too commonplace.&rdquo; She glanced absently
over at the book Nance was reading.
&ldquo;Victor Hugo would probably have put it this
way: &lsquo;It was the fifteenth of May, 17&mdash;. A
young girl was hurrying along the Rue&mdash;&mdash;.
She paused at the house, No.&nbsp;11.&rsquo; Oh, dear,&rdquo;
pondered Molly, &ldquo;one has to tell something very
important to write in that way. It&rsquo;s like sending
a telegram. Just as much as possible expressed
in the fewest possible words. Can the professor
mean that? Would he mind if I asked him and
then at the same time, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Again the
wandering thoughts broke off. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he should have misunderstood about this morning.
Is there no way I can explain without involving
Judy? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! How
complicated life is, and what a complicated nature
is Judy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were two quick raps on the door. Molly
and Nance exchanged frightened glances. It
was not the masonic tap of their friends, and no
one else would have knocked on a door which advertised
a Busy sign. There was, in fact, a note
of authority in the double rap. Some instinct
prevented Nance from calling out &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; a
matter later for self-congratulation. She rose
and opened the door and President Walker entered.
If Miss Walker had ever paid a visit to
a student before, the girls had not heard of it.
It was, so far as they knew, an entirely unprecedented
happening and quite sufficient to make innocent
people look guilty and set hearts to pumping
blood at double-quick time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw your Busy sign,&rdquo; said Miss Walker,
glancing from one startled face to the other, &ldquo;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
I shall not keep you long. What a pretty room,&rdquo;
she added, looking about her approvingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heavens, it&rsquo;s straight,&rdquo; thought Nance,
groaning mentally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Miss Walker?&rdquo; asked
Molly, pushing forward one of the easy chairs.</p>

<p>The President sat down. There was a plate
of &ldquo;cloudbursts&rdquo; on the table. Would it be disrespectful
to offer the President some of this delectable
candy? Nance considered it would be,
decidedly so. But Molly, a slave to the laws of
hospitality, took what might be called a leap in
the dark and silently held the plate in front of the
President. If this turned out to be a visit of
state it was rather a risky thing to do. But Miss
Walker helped herself to one piece and then demanded
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delicious,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did you make it, Miss
Brown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Walker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had been purely a stroke of luck with Molly,
who had no way to know that Miss Walker had
a sweet tooth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have that recipe. What makes it so
light?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whites of eggs beaten very stiff, and the
rest of it is just melted brown sugar. It&rsquo;s very
easy,&rdquo; added Molly, forming a resolution to make
the President a plate of &ldquo;cloudbursts&rdquo; without
loss of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the third girl who shares this apartment
with you?&rdquo; asked Miss Walker, unexpectedly
coming back to business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Julia Kean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is she to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is sick in bed to-day, Miss Walker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem! Cold, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more excitement than anything else,&rdquo; put
in Molly. &ldquo;The junior play&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. She was &lsquo;Viola,&rsquo; of course,&rdquo; said the
President.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see she had a bad attack of stage fright,&rdquo;
continued Molly, &ldquo;and Judy is so excitable and
sensitive. She exaggerated what happened and
it made her ill.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did happen? She forgot her lines,
as I recall. But that often occurs. Even professionals
have been known to forget their parts.
Ellen Terry is quite notorious for her bad memory,
but she is a great actress, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were silent. They wondered what
in the world Miss Walker was driving at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then what happened next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at her blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo; repeated Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I want you to begin and tell me the
whole thing from beginning to end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly rested her chin on her hand and looked
out of the window. This is what had been
familiarly spoken of in college as being &ldquo;on the
grill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want us to tell, Miss Walker?&rdquo;
asked Nance with a surprising amount of courage
in her tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; said the President sternly,
&ldquo;where you were between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock
on Friday night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were on the lake,&rdquo; announced Nance, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
keen appreciation of the fact that when President
Walker made a direct question she expected a
direct answer and there was no getting around it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to tell me that you three girls
went rowing on the lake alone at that hour?
What escapade is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was so stern that it made Molly
quake in her boots, but Nance was as heroic as
an early Christian martyr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not a mad escapade. We did it because
we had to,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance paused. This was the crucial point. It
looked as if Miss Walker must be told about
Judy&rsquo;s folly, or themselves be disgraced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They came for me,&rdquo; announced a hoarse voice
from the door.</p>

<p>It was such an unexpected interruption that all
three women started nervously, but if Molly and
Nance had been more observant they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
noticed the President stifle a smile which twitched
the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>Judy, in a long red dressing-gown, her hair in
great disorder and her eyes glittering feverishly,
came trailing into the room. In one hand she
grasped Nance&rsquo;s slipper and with the other she
made a dramatic gesture, pointing to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They came for me,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I had
been angry and said cruel, unjust things to Molly.
Everybody went off and left me after the play.
I was locked out and I was so unhappy, I wanted
to be alone. Water always comforts me. You
see, I was born at sea, and I took a canoe from
the boat house and paddled into the middle of
the lake. Then those two Sweet Spirits of Niter
came for me, and the canoe upset and I&mdash;I
dropped my slipper somewhere, 5-B is the number&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know who found it&mdash;here&rsquo;s its
mate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Judy waved the slipper over her head
and laughed wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child&rsquo;s delirious,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Walker,
smiling in spite of herself.</p>

<p>They persuaded Judy to get back into bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the President sent Nance flying for the doctor.
Presently, when Judy had dropped off to sleep
again, Molly finished the story of that exciting
evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; said the President, slipping
her arm around Molly&rsquo;s waist and drawing her
down on the arm of the chair, &ldquo;what prompted
you to go to the lake and nowhere else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never explain really what it was,&rdquo; replied
Molly. &ldquo;I dreamed that someone said
&lsquo;hurry.&rsquo; I wasn&rsquo;t even thinking of Judy when I
started to dress. You see, we thought she had
gone to bed. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of the lake, either.
It was just as if I was walking in my sleep, Nance
said. Then we found Judy wasn&rsquo;t in her room,
and I knew she needed me. I remember we ran
all the way to the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange, strange!&rdquo; said Miss Walker.</p>

<p>She drew Molly&rsquo;s face down to her own and
kissed her. There were tears on the President&rsquo;s
cheek and Molly looked the other way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, Molly,&rdquo; she said after a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
&ldquo;you remind me of my dear sister who died
twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a good while before Nance returned
with Dr. McLean and in the interval of waiting
Molly and Miss Walker talked of many things.
Molly told her how they had buried the slipper
on Round Head, and of how they had seen the
Professor and been frightened. They talked of
Judy&rsquo;s temperament and of what kind of mental
training Judy should have to learn to control
her wild spirits. From that the talk drifted to
Molly&rsquo;s affairs, and then she asked the President
to do her the honor of drinking a cup of tea in
her humble apartment. The two women spent
an intimate and delightful hour together, with
Judy sound asleep in the next room, and no one
to disturb them because of that blessed Busy sign.</p>

<p>At last Dr. McLean came blustering in, and,
seeing the President and Molly in close converse
over their cups of tea, chuckled delightedly and
observed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all alike, the women folk&mdash;the talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
lasts as long as the tea lasts, and there&rsquo;s always
another cup in the pot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a look at your patient, doctor,&rdquo; said
Miss Walker, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll save that extra cup in
the pot for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor was not disturbed over Judy&rsquo;s delirium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s joost quinine and excitement that&rsquo;s made
her go a bit daffy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Keep her quiet for
a day or so. She&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Imagine their surprise, ten minutes later, when
Margaret Wakefield and the Williamses, peeping
into the room, found Molly and Nance entertaining
the President of Wellington and Dr. McLean
at tea. The news spread quickly along the corridor
and when the distinguished guests presently
departed almost every girl in the Quadrangle
had made it her business to be lingering near the
stairway or wandering in the hall.</p>

<p>Only one person heard nothing of it, and that
was Minerva Higgins, who, after Vespers, had
taken a long walk. Nobody told her about it
afterward, because she was not popular with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Quadrangle girls and had formed her associations
with some freshmen in the village. When
it was given out that evening that Miss Walker
had come to see about Judy, who had been quite
ill, the talk died down.</p>

<p>Having dropped the heavy load of responsibility
they had been carrying for two days, Molly
and Nance felt foolishly gay. Molly made Miss
Walker a box of cloudbursts before she went to
bed, while Nance read aloud a thrilling and highly
exciting detective story borrowed from Edith
Williams, whose shelves held books for every
mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Nance,&rdquo; observed Molly, when
the story was finished, &ldquo;how do you suppose Miss
Walker found it all out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Professor Green, of course,&rdquo; answered
Nance in a matter of fact voice. &ldquo;There was
never any doubt in my mind from the first moment
she came into the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Molly, thunderstruck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no other way. He saw us burying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the slipper and I suppose he thought it his
duty to inform on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t feel it his duty to inform on Judith
Blount when she cut the electric wires that night,&rdquo;
broke in Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t think that was as wrong
as rowing on the lake with boys from Exmoor.
Besides, she was his relative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly took off her slipper and held it up as if
she were going to pitch it with all her force across
the room. Then she dropped it gently on the
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>A SWOPPING PARTY AND A MOCK TRIAL.</small></h2>


<p>There was never any tedious convalescing for
Judy; no tiresome transition from illness to
health. As soon as she determined in her mind
that she was well, she arose from her bed and
walked, and neither friendly remonstrances nor
doctor&rsquo;s orders could induce her to return.</p>

<p>On Monday morning she appeared in the sitting
room wearing a black dress with widow&rsquo;s
bands of white muslin around the collar and
cuffs. Molly and Nance were a little uneasy at
first, thinking that the delirium still lingered, but
Judy seemed entirely rational.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Judy,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, &ldquo;are you a
widow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall wear mourning for awhile,&rdquo; answered
Judy solemnly, ignoring Molly&rsquo;s facetious question.
&ldquo;It is my only way of showing that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a penitent. I can&rsquo;t wear sackcloth and ashes
as they do in Oriental countries or flagellate my
shoulders with a spiked whip like a mediæval
monk; nor can I go on a pilgrimage to a sacred
shrine. So I have decided to give up colors for
awhile and wear black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly kissed her and said no more. She knew
that Judy went into everything she did heart
and soul even unto the outward and visible symbol
of clothes, and if wearing black was her
way of showing public repentance she felt only
a great respect for her friend&rsquo;s sincerity of
motive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are we to tell people when they ask
if you have gone into mourning, Judy, because
they certainly will?&rdquo; demanded Nance, taking a
more practical and less romantic view of the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell them I&rsquo;m doing penance,&rdquo; answered Judy,
and thus it got out around college that Judy was
making public amends for her angry words to
Molly, and there was a good deal of secret amusement,
of which Judy was as serenely unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
as a pious pilgrim journeying barefoot to a holy
tomb.</p>

<p>In the midst of these happenings there came
a note one day from Mrs. McLean inviting the
three young girls to the annual junior week-end
house party at Exmoor. Their hosts were to be
Andy McLean, George Green and Lawrence
Upton and they were to stay at the Chapter
House from Friday night until Sunday noon.
It meant a round of gayeties from beginning to
end, but to Molly it meant something almost out
of reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clothes!&rdquo; she exclaimed tragically, &ldquo;I must
have clothes. I can&rsquo;t go to Exmoor looking like
little orphan Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in vain that Judy and Nance offered
to share their things with her. Molly obstinately
refused to listen to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t need any colored clothes, anyhow,&rdquo;
said Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will, Judy. You just must come out
of those widow&rsquo;s weeds for the house party,&rdquo;
Molly urged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Judy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a vow and until
that vow is fulfilled I shall never wear colors.
I&rsquo;ve sent two dresses down to the Wellington
Dye Works to be dyed black. Fortunately my
suit is black already and so is my hat. Now, I
have a proposition to make, Molly. I&rsquo;m in need
of funds more than clothes just now and I&rsquo;ll sell
you my yellow gauze for the contents of Martin
Luther. He must be pretty full by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s plumb full,&rdquo; answered Molly proudly.
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t realized how much I had put in until
I tried to drop a quarter in this morning, and
lo, and behold, he couldn&rsquo;t accommodate another
cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held up the china pig and shook him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much should you think he&rsquo;d hold altogether?&rdquo;
asked Judy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be getting
the best of the bargain and perhaps Martin
Luther is worth more than the dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested Molly. &ldquo;He could never
be worth that much. I think he has about fifteen
dollars in his tum-tum. I&rsquo;ve put in all the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
I earned from cloudbursts and about ten dollars,
changed up small, for tutoring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy insisted on adding a blue silk blouse and
a pair of yellow silk stockings to the collection
to be sold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sell them to someone else if you won&rsquo;t buy
them,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;and if you need a dress,
you might as well take this one off my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Molly finally agreed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll break
open Martin, and count the money and, if there&rsquo;s
anything like a decent sum, I&rsquo;ll buy the dress.
Let&rsquo;s make a party of it,&rdquo; she added brightly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut the hickory-nut cake that came from
home last night, and Nance can make fudge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was like Molly&rsquo;s passion for entertaining to
turn the breaking open of the china bank into a
festival. Nance had once remarked it was one
thing to have a convivial soul and quite another
to have the ready provisions, and Molly never invited
her friends to a bare board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try on the dress and let&rsquo;s see how you look
in it, Molly dear,&rdquo; ordered Judy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the bank to-night with due ceremony, but I want
to see you in the yellow dress now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls were about the same height and
build. Molly was not so well developed across
the chest as her friend and was more slender
through the hips. But the dress fitted her to
perfection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a dream,&rdquo; cried Nance, when
Molly presently appeared in the yellow dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, you are adorable,&rdquo; exclaimed Judy.
&ldquo;You always look better in my clothes than I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They always fit me better than my own,&rdquo;
said Molly, looking at herself in the mirror over
the mantel. &ldquo;I feel like a princess,&rdquo; she ejaculated,
blushing at her own charming image. &ldquo;Oh,
Judy, I have no right to deprive you of this lovely
gown. Your mother, I&rsquo;m sure, would be very
angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma is never angry,&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;That
is why I am so impossible. Besides, I told you
I needed the money. I have spent all my allowance
and I won&rsquo;t get another cent for two weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly took off the dress and laid it carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in the box, stuffing tissue paper under the folds
to prevent premature wrinkles. Her eyes dwelt
lingeringly on the pale yellow masses of chiffon
and lace.</p>

<p>It would certainly be the solution of her
troubles, and oh, the feeling of comfort one has
in a really beautiful dress! She put the top on
the box and pushed it away from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll decide in the morning, Judy. I can&rsquo;t make
up my mind quite yet. It seems like highway
robbery to take the most beautiful dress you
have and the most expensive, too, I am certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I never liked the color,&rdquo; cried Judy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m determined to wear black. When I have on
black I feel superior to all persons wearing colors.
It gives me dignity. There is a richness about
robes of sable hue. Some day I&rsquo;m going to have
a black velvet evening dress made quite plain
with an immense train stretching all the way
across the room. My only ornaments will be a
great diamond star in my hair and a necklace
of the same, and I shall carry a large fan made
of black ostrich feathers.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls laughed at this picture of magnificence
and as Molly hurried away to invite the
guests to the spread she heard Nance remark:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look like the bride of the undertaker
in that costume, Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I shall look like the Queen of
Night, Anna Oldham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy went to the door and looked out. Molly
was safely around the corner of the Quadrangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think Molly
would let me give her the dress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not. You know how proud she
is. It&rsquo;s going to be hard to persuade her to buy
it at that price. You know it&rsquo;s worth lots more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only do something,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If
I only had a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the chance will slip up on you, Judy,
when you least expect it. That&rsquo;s the way chances
always do,&rdquo; said Nance.</p>

<p>It occurred to Judy, thinking over the matter
of the yellow dress later, that it might be fun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to have a &ldquo;Barter and Exchange Party,&rdquo; and if
all the girls were swopping things Molly could
be more easily persuaded to take the yellow dress.
All guests therefore were notified to bring anything
they wanted to swop or sell to the rooms
of the three friends that night.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a very exciting affair. The
divans were piled with exchangeable property.
Jessie Lynch brought more things than anybody
else, ribbon bows, silk scarfs, several dresses and
a velvet toque. Millicent Porter, who now spent
more time in the Quadrangle than at Beta Phi
House, to the surprise of the girls, brought a
rather dingy collection of things which no one
would either swop or buy. But she enjoyed herself
immensely. Edith Williams made two trips
to carry all the books she wished to exchange for
other books, clothes, hats or money. But Otoyo
Sen had the most interesting collection and was
the gayest person that night. She was willing
to exchange anything she had just for the fun
of it.</p>

<p>It was so exciting that they forgot all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Martin Luther until the time arrived for refreshments
and they gathered about the hickory-nut
cake, now a famous delicacy at Wellington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What surprises me is how pleased everybody
is to get rid of something someone else is equally
pleased to get,&rdquo; observed Margaret. &ldquo;Now, for
instance, I have a black hat I have always
hated because it wobbles on my head. I feel as
if I had received a gift to have exchanged it for
this green one of Judy&rsquo;s. And Judy&rsquo;s so contented
she&rsquo;s wearing my black one still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I am the fortunate one,&rdquo; said Otoyo.
&ldquo;I have acquired an excellent library for three
ordinary cotton kimonos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But such lovely kimonos,&rdquo; exclaimed Edith.
&ldquo;Katherine and I are in luck. Look at this pale
blue dressing gown, please, for a French dictionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the loveliest of all,&rdquo; broke in Molly,
&ldquo;amber beads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they did not appear becomingly on me,&rdquo;
protested Otoyo, not wishing to seem worsted
in her bargains. &ldquo;And what do I receive in exchange?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
A pair of beautiful knitted slippers for
winter time, so warm, so comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were too little for me,&rdquo; announced
Molly. &ldquo;It was no deprivation to exchange them
for a beautiful necklace. Really, Judy, this was
a most original scheme of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about Martin Luther?&rdquo; asked someone.
&ldquo;I thought this spread was really for the
purpose of counting up the pennies he had been
accumulating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly took the china pig from the shelf and
placed him on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shall I break him?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Shall
I crush him with one blow of the hammer, or
shall I knock off his head on the steam heater?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Martin!&rdquo; ejaculated Edith. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not
a wild boar to be hunted down and exterminated.
He&rsquo;s a kindly domestic animal who has performed
the task set for him by a wise providence. I think
he should choose his own death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every condemned man has a right to a lawyer,&rdquo;
said Margaret. &ldquo;I offer my services to
Martin Luther and will consult him in private.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him a trial by jury,&rdquo; broke in
Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s he accused of?&rdquo; demanded Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s accused of withholding funds held in
trust for you,&rdquo; put in Margaret promptly.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of fun at the expense
of Martin Luther and his mock trial. Katherine
presided as Judge. There were two witnesses for
the defense and two on the other side, and Margaret&rsquo;s
speech for the accused would have done
credit to a real lawyer. The jury, consisting of
three girls, Otoyo, Mabel Hinton and Rosomond
Chase&mdash;Millicent Porter had excused herself with
the plea of a headache and departed&mdash;sat on the
case five minutes and decided that the pig should
be made to surrender Molly&rsquo;s fund in the quickest
possible time and by the quickest possible means.</p>

<p>It was almost time to separate for the night
when Molly at last placed Martin Luther on a
tray in the center of the table and with a sharp
rap of the hammer broke him into little bits.</p>

<p>If interest had not been so concentrated on the
amount of money hidden in the pig, perhaps it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
might have occurred to the company that Molly
and her two friends had been playing a joke on
them when they looked at the heap of ruins on
the tray. But if this suspicion did enter the mind
of anyone, it was dissolved at once at sight of
Molly&rsquo;s white face and quivering lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My money!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>What happened was this. When the china
pig was demolished, there rolled from his ruins
no silver money but a varied collection of buttons
and bogus stage money made of tin. Only about
a dollar in real silver was to be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a blow is this!&rdquo; at last exclaimed Molly,
breaking the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what does it mean?&rdquo; demanded Rosomond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said Nance, &ldquo;that someone has
taken all Molly&rsquo;s savings out of the china pig and
substituted&mdash;this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pointed to the pile of stage money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they couldn&rsquo;t have done it,&rdquo; cried Judy.
&ldquo;How could they have fished it up through such
a small slot?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a low, miserable trick!&rdquo; cried Katherine.</p>

<p>It was a despicable action. Who among all
the bright, intelligent students at Wellington
could have been capable of such a dastardly
thing? They agreed that it must have been a
student. None of the college attendants could
have planned it out so carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else has missed things?&rdquo; asked Margaret
with a sudden thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Jessie, &ldquo;but I never mentioned
it because I&rsquo;m so careless and it did seem
to be my own fault. I lost five dollars last week
out of my purse. I left it on the window sill in
the gym. and forgot about it. When I came back
later the purse was there, but the money was
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How horrid!&rdquo; cried Molly, her soul revolting
in disgust at anything dishonest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth I have not been able
to find my gold beads for nearly two weeks,&rdquo; put
in Judy. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen them since&mdash;&rdquo; she
paused and flushed, &ldquo;since the night of our play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
I remember leaving them on my dressing table
that morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly and Nance exchanged glances, recalling
the mysterious visitor to their room that night.</p>

<p>Several of the other girls had missed small
sums of money and jewelry which they had not
thought of mentioning at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how on earth was this managed?&rdquo; demanded
Jessie, pointing dramatically to the
broken china pig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect,&rdquo; replied Molly, &ldquo;that this is not
the real Martin Luther. When I bought him
there were several others just like him on the
shelf at the store. Whoever did this must have
bought another Martin and the stage money at
the same time. They have a lot of it at the store,
silver and greenbacks, too. I saw it myself when
I bought Martin. They keep it for class plays,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long discussion about what ought
to be done. The housekeeper must be told, of
course, next morning and a list of all missing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
articles made out, headed by Molly&rsquo;s loss of almost
fifteen dollars.</p>

<p>It was rather a tragic ending to the jolly hickory-nut
cake party. Molly tried to laugh away
her disappointment about her savings, but she
could not disguise to herself what it actually
meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t buy your dress, Judy,&rdquo; she
announced, when the company had disbanded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mend up one of last year&rsquo;s dresses. It will
be all right. It&rsquo;s a lesson to me not to place so
much importance on clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy said nothing, but she made a mental resolution
that Molly should have that dress.</p>

<p>The next morning the housekeeper was properly
notified of what had happened and it was
not long before the rumor spread that somewhere
about college there dwelt a thief. So remote did
such a person seem from the Wellington girls
that the thief came to be regarded as a kind of
evil spirit lurking in the shadows and gliding
through the halls.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>ALARMS AND DISCOVERIES.</small></h2>


<p>Several things of importance to this history
happened during the week before the house party
at Exmoor.</p>

<p>One morning, just before chapel, Molly was
visited by several members of the Shakespearean
Society, who presented her with a scroll of membership
and fastened a pin on her blouse. They
then solemnly shook hands and marched out in
good order. By this token Molly became a full
fledged member of that exclusive body. Margaret
Wakefield, Jessie Lynch and Edith Williams
were also taken into the society. Most of
the other girls in the circle were elected to the
various societies that day. Judy and Katherine
became &ldquo;Olla Podridas,&rdquo; which, as all Wellington
knows, is Spanish for mixed soup. Nance
was elected into the &ldquo;Octogons,&rdquo; and all the girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
belonged to one or the other of the two big Greek
letter societies.</p>

<p>If Judy had any feelings regarding the Shakespeareans,
she was careful to keep them well hidden
under her gay and laughing exterior.</p>

<p>The Shakespeareans at Beta Phi House gave
a supper for the new members, and later Millicent
Porter, in a stunning, theatrical looking costume
of old blue velvet, received them in her
rooms. Margaret and Edith wore their best
to this affair. The Shakespeareans were a dressy
lot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why, in the name of goodness, they
ever asked me to belong,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly to
herself, as she got into her white muslin, which
was really the best she could do. &ldquo;I wish I could
surprise somebody with something,&rdquo; her thoughts
continued. &ldquo;College friends are just like members
of the same family. I can&rsquo;t even surprise
the girls with a shirtwaist. They are intimately
acquainted with every rag I possess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly enjoyed the Beta Phi party, however, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
spite of her dress, which Millicent Porter had
dignified by calling it a &ldquo;lingerie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much nicer you look than the other girls
in more elaborate things,&rdquo; she said admiringly.</p>

<p>Molly felt gratified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel nicer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have a weakness
for fine clothes. I love to hear the rustle
of silk against silk. Your blue velvet dress is
like a beautiful picture to me. I could look and
look at it. There&rsquo;s a kind of depth to it like mist
on blue water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Millicent bridled with pleased vanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rather nice,&rdquo; she admitted modestly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a French dress made by the same dressmaker
who designs clothes for a big actress.
Don&rsquo;t you want to see some of my work? I have
put it on exhibition to-night. I thought it would
interest the new members. The girls here are
quite familiar with it, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was delighted to see the craftsmanship
of this unusual young woman, who appeared to
be a peculiar mixture of pretentiousness and
genius.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>When, presently, she led Molly into the little
den where her silver work was spread out on
view it was almost as if she had turned into a
little old man and was taking a customer into the
back of his shop.</p>

<p>Some of the other girls had followed and they
now stood in an admiring circle around the table
whereon were displayed rings and necklaces,
buckles and several silver platters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a wonder,&rdquo; cried Molly, deeply impressed.</p>

<p>Millicent accepted this compliment with a complacent
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa and mamma think I am,&rdquo; she remarked,
&ldquo;but I have artistic knowledge enough to know
that this is only a beginning. When I am able
to make a bas-relief of Greek dancing figures
on a silver box, I shall call myself really great.
At present I am only near-great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with these things?&rdquo;
asked Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. They just accumulate and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
pack them away. I don&rsquo;t have to sell any of
them, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to exhibit some of them at
the George Washington Bazaar?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
&ldquo;The Bazaar will sell them for you at
ten per cent commission. The money goes to
the student fund. You can have a booth if you
like and dress up as Benvenuto Cellini or some
famous worker in silver. I am chairman and
can make any appointments I choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly could hardly keep from smiling over the
expression on Millicent&rsquo;s face. The worker in
silver and the dealer in antiques were struggling
for supremacy in the soul of their descendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried in great excitement, &ldquo;I will
fix it up like a Florentine shop, full of beautiful
old stuffs and curios. It will be the most beautiful
booth in the Bazaar. And I will choose
Miss Brown to assist me. You shall be dressed
as a Florentine lady of the Renaissance. I have
the very costume.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Margaret, as Chairman of the Bazaar,
preferred all appointments to be made officially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but seeing that Millicent was very much in earnest
and that such a booth would greatly add to
the picturesqueness of the affair, she made no
objections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing I would advise you to do,
Miss Porter,&rdquo; she said when the plan was settled,
&ldquo;and that is to keep your silver things under
lock and key because there is a thief about in
Wellington. You might as well know it, because,
sooner or later, you&rsquo;ll lose something. We all of
us have. My monogram ring went this morning.
I left it on the marble slab in the wash
room and when I came back for it not three minutes
later it was gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, &ldquo;I do hate things
like that to happen. Why will people do such
things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Millicent shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they can&rsquo;t help themselves,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost a few little things myself,&rdquo;
she added. &ldquo;But come into my room, Miss
Brown, and let&rsquo;s talk about your costume. I
have a gold net cap that will be charming.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>For the next half hour Molly was lost in the
delights of Millicent&rsquo;s collection of beautiful theatrical
costumes, pieces of old brocades and velvets.
She drew them carelessly from a carved
oak chest and tossed them on the bed in a shimmering
mass of rich colors. Molly lingered so
late over these &ldquo;rich stuffs&rdquo; that she was obliged
to run all the way back to the Quadrangle and
fell breathless and exhausted on a stone bench
just inside the court as the watchman closed the
gates.</p>

<p>Nance and Judy were late, too. Nance had
been to a secret conclave of the Octogons and
Judy had been having a jolly, convivial time with
the Olla Podridas. The three girls met in their
sitting room as the last stroke of ten vibrated
through the building. They were undressing in
the dark stealthily, in order to avoid the eager
eye of the housekeeper, who was not popular,
when they heard a great racket in the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
called several voices through half open doors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The housekeeper making her rounds for the
night passed them on the run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been robbed! I&rsquo;ve been robbed!&rdquo; wailed
the voice of Minerva Higgins. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand
having my things stolen from me. Who has
dared enter my room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been robbed of?&rdquo; asked the
matron sharply. She was a lazy woman and detested
disturbances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two of my best gold medals I won at Mill
Town High School. They were pure gold and
very valuable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; laughed Judy. &ldquo;If anything
in school could be spared, it is her gold medals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only in the same box with all the rest
of us, Miss Higgins,&rdquo; called a student who
roomed across the hall. &ldquo;Everybody in the
Quadrangle has lost something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t lost gold medals,&rdquo; cried Minerva.
&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t had them to lose. I could
have spared anything else. I valued them more
than everything I possess. They will be heirlooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
some day for my children to show with
pride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were stifled laughs from several of the
rooms, and someone called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you don&rsquo;t have any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll leave &rsquo;em to her grandchildren,&rdquo;
called another voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor, silly, little thing,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, as
the matron, intensely annoyed, went heavily past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Fatty&rsquo;s gone now. Let&rsquo;s light a lamp,&rdquo;
suggested Judy, who either felt intense respect
or none at all for all persons. There was no
moderation in her feelings one way or the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer thing about this thief-business,&rdquo;
sighed Molly. &ldquo;It makes me uncomfortable. I
can&rsquo;t think of anyone I could even remotely suspect
of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be a real klep.,&rdquo; observed Judy, &ldquo;or
she never would want the fair Minerva&rsquo;s gold
medals. They&rsquo;re of no use to anybody but
Minerva.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Miss Walker will get another
detective like Miss Steel?&rdquo; asked Nance. &ldquo;She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
was a fine one. The way she tipped around on
noiseless felt slippers and listened outside people&rsquo;s
doors was enough to scare any thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;She was the real thing.
And she wanted everything quiet. If Minerva
Higgins had set up a yowl like that at Queen&rsquo;s
she would have been properly sat upon by Miss
Steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Molly&rsquo;s mind had been especially acute that
evening she would have noticed that her two
friends were keeping up a sort of continuous duet
as they lingered over their undressing. As it
was, she barely heard their chatter because she
was thinking of something far removed from
thieves and detectives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be called down about the light if you
don&rsquo;t hurry, girls,&rdquo; she cautioned. &ldquo;Why are you
so slow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, did you know there was a package
over here on the table addressed to you,
Molly?&rdquo; said Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no; what can it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Filled with curiosity, Molly made haste to cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the string around a square pasteboard box.
Whatever was inside had been wrapped in quantities
of white tissue paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It feels like china,&rdquo; cried Molly, tearing off
the wrappings. &ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after ten, young ladies,&rdquo; said a stern voice
outside the door.</p>

<p>Judy turned out the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Martin Luther, girls,&rdquo; whispered Molly.</p>

<p>Judy crept to her room and returned presently
with a little electric dark lantern her father had
given her. This she flashed on the china pig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One sinner hath repented,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;It is Martin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance reached for the hammer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break him open,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s, see
if the money&rsquo;s safe. He might be filled with stage
money, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly struck Martin Luther with the hammer,
muffling the sound with a corner of the rug. The
flashlight revealed quantities of silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it all back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
I&rsquo;m glad the thief repented and I&rsquo;m glad, oh, so
glad, to get the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now the sale is on again,&rdquo; said Judy,
jumping about the room in a wild, noiseless dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t resist it,&rdquo; ejaculated Molly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy
the dress if you really want to sell it, Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked carefully at the address on the
box. It was printed with a soft pencil and merely
said: &ldquo;Miss M. Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose the girl felt sorry,&rdquo; Molly remarked.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a pity she started up so soon
again after her repentance and took Minerva&rsquo;s
medals.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>&ldquo;THE MOVING FINGER WRITES.&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>The girls had agreed to pack all their clothes
in one trunk and carry a suitcase apiece to the
Junior Week-End Party at Exmoor. Nance was
official packer and stood knee-deep in finery while
she considered whether it was better to begin
with party capes or slippers. Molly was studying
and Judy was stretched on the divan idly swinging
one foot.</p>

<p>Otoyo poked her head in the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask advice of kind friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly looked up and smiled. She had once
heard a preacher say that humility was as necessary
to a well-rounded character as a sense of
humor and she could see now what he meant.
Otoyo was an excellent illustration. She was
filled with humble gratitude for little kindnesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
never boasted and never forgot her perfect
manners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you may, little one,&rdquo; spoke up Judy.
&ldquo;Come right in and state your grievances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have no grievances. I have only happinesses,&rdquo;
said Otoyo. &ldquo;But I am packing and
I wish to ask advices regarding clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clothes for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Exmoor,&rdquo; replied Otoyo, blushing and
casting down her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you dear little Jap, you didn&rsquo;t tell us,&rdquo;
exclaimed Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have obtained the knowledge of it myself
only this morning. Mrs. McLean has so kindly
offered to look after little Japanese girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is your escort?&rdquo; they demanded in
one chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Green,&rdquo; said Otoyo, trying not to
show how intensely proud she felt of the honor.
&ldquo;He is what you call &lsquo;a-lum-nus,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and he invites me to go with him, and Mr. Andrew
McLean, junior, is making out a card of
dances for me. Is it not wonderful? And is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
it not of great good fortune that I have now
learned to dance?&rdquo; She began circling about the
room. &ldquo;Only I can do it much better alone. Poor
little Japanese girl will be frightened to dance
with American gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an adorable little person,&rdquo; exclaimed
Molly, kissing her, &ldquo;and young American gentleman
will be only too glad to dance with little
Japanese girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otoyo was now well provided with clothes,
and there being still plenty of room in the trunk,
they allowed her to pack two evening dresses and
a diminutive black satin party wrap with their
things.</p>

<p>Molly was half sorry that Professor Green
was going. Except at classes, she had never seen
him since that Sunday morning on Round Head.
Once he had smiled at her like an old friend
when they had met in the main hall, but she was
careful not to return the smile and bowed coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am disappointed,&rdquo; she had thought.
&ldquo;I am glad Prexy found out about us that night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
but he needn&rsquo;t have been the one to tell. I hope
I shall be too much engaged in having a good
time at Exmoor to see him. I am glad Lawrence
Upton is going to look after me, because he always
does so much for one. It was nice of Professor
Green to take Otoyo. He is kind, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, that afternoon when the trolley
started with its load of Wellington guests for
Exmoor&mdash;there were several other parties&mdash;Molly
found herself seated between Mrs. McLean
and Professor Green. How it had happened she
could not tell. She had intended to sit anywhere
but next the Professor, whom she regarded as
a false friend. But there she was and the Professor
was saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brown, you and I have been almost
strangers of late. Are you working so hard that
you have no time for old friends this winter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly paused for an instant to consider what
she should reply to this question. Then she said
a thing so bitter and foreign to her nature that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the Professor gave a start of surprise and Molly
felt that someone else must have said it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have plenty of time for really <em>loyal</em> friends,
Professor Green,&rdquo; she said in a frigid tone of
voice. She turned her back and began to talk
to Mrs. McLean, and for the rest of the trip the
Professor devoted himself to Otoyo.</p>

<p>Molly was in high spirits when she reached
Exmoor. She was determined not to let her cruel
speech ruin her good time. But through all the
gayeties of that afternoon and evening, at the
teas, the dinner and the Glee Club concert, the
tang of its bitterness reached her. Across the
aisle at the concert she could see Professor Green
sitting by Otoyo, smiling gravely while the little
Japanese girl entertained him, but never once
did he look in Molly&rsquo;s direction. A lump rose
in her throat and she dropped her gaze to the
program.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is never right to make mean speeches,&rdquo;
she decided, &ldquo;no matter how much provocation
one has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you having a good time?&rdquo; asked Lawrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Upton at her side. &ldquo;You look a little tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a lovely time,&rdquo; answered Molly,
&ldquo;and I thought I was looking my best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you couldn&rsquo;t look any better. I think you
are&mdash;well, the prettiest girl in the room. I meant
there was a kind of sad look in your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to cover it up with compliments,&rdquo;
answered Molly. &ldquo;When a thing&rsquo;s said, you
can&rsquo;t change it, you know. It&rsquo;s like this:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be so severe, Miss Molly,&rdquo; said
Lawrence humbly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of what you said, particularly,&rdquo;
said Molly. &ldquo;I was thinking of any speech
one might make and regret and never be able to
recall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> sad,&rdquo; said Lawrence. &ldquo;I was certain
of it. Will it make you any gladder to hear about
to-morrow? You are engaged for every hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in the day. I had a great to-do keeping a little
time for myself. Three fellows wanted to take
you driving in the morning, but I reserved that
privilege for yours truly. Dodo and I are going
to drive you and Miss Judy over to Hillesdell
after breakfast. Then there&rsquo;s the Junior Lunch.
That&rsquo;s quite a big affair, you know. It&rsquo;s like a
reception. Prexy always comes to that and any
of the alumni who happen to be down. A crowd
of them come usually. Andy&rsquo;s giving a tea in
the Chapter rooms and there are some other teas,
and then come the dinner and the ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything left of us by then,&rdquo; said
Molly, laughing.</p>

<p>It was an intermission and everybody was visiting
as they did at the Wellington Glee Club concerts.
Molly, the center of a jolly crowd of young
people, joined in the merriment and talk and all
the time there was a taste of bitterness on her
lips and in her ear a voice kept dinning over
and over:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have plenty of time for really loyal friends,
Professor Green.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>That night, when they had gone to bed in their
rooms in the Chapter House, they were serenaded
by a roving band of juniors. When at last the
serenaders moved away and the house was still,
Molly could not go to sleep.</p>

<p>Dozens of times she repeated her cruel speech.
She analyzed and parsed it, as she used to parse
sentences years before in her first lessons in
grammar. She named the subject, the predicate,
the object, and modifying words. She tried to
define the meaning of the word loyal. What
were its synonyms? Faithful was one, of course.
When she closed her eyes, she could see her
speech written in red across a black background
like a flaming sign. Was the Professor hurt or
angry or both? She recalled every kindness he
had ever done for her and there were many. She
remembered with a burning blush what pains he
and his sister had taken to make her have a happy
Christmas a year ago. He had informed President
Walker on her, of course, but he was only
doing his duty. And she had made that cruel
speech!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have plenty of time for really loyal friends,
Professor Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mind traveled in a circle. She tossed and
turned, trying one side until it ached and then
trying the other; resting on her back for a moment
and finding the position intolerable.</p>

<p>At last she fell asleep and woke up stiff and
weary in the morning, devoutly wishing the day
were well over.</p>

<p>She had hoped to see Professor Green in the
morning, if only for a moment, but he had returned
to Wellington, leaving the entertainment
of Otoyo in charge of some of his brother&rsquo;s
friends.</p>

<p>Of what earthly pleasure is a beautiful corn-colored
evening gown when one&rsquo;s heart is like
a lump of lead and one&rsquo;s conscience heavy within?</p>

<p>All her numerous partners at the ball could
not console Molly, nor could the knowledge that
she was looking her best as she floated through
the dances in her diaphanous dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know now how Judy felt after she was so
unkind to me at the junior play,&rdquo; she thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
&ldquo;and, if heaven is kind to me, I hope never to
say anything to hurt anyone again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime there were those who were
enjoying themselves to the utmost limit of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Otoyo Sen, in a seventh heaven, was dancing
with young Andy, who towered above her like
a lighthouse over a cottage.</p>

<p>Judy in her black dress was sparkling with
vivacity. Her fluffy light brown hair gleamed
yellow and her skin was cream white, against
the dark folds of her chiffon frock. Could this
be the same Judy who, only a few weeks ago, was
contemplating&mdash;heaven knows what?</p>

<p>Nance, with one eye on Andy, was also happy
and light-hearted. How trim and charming she
looked in her white silk dress!</p>

<p>Molly found herself laughing and talking a
great deal, and all the time she was thinking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back to-morrow at noon. On Monday
the holidays begin. Oh, if I can only see
him before he goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great many young men came down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
station to see them off next morning. There was
a din of farewells. On all sides girlish voices
were calling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the jolliest dance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had a better time in all my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awfully nice of you to ask us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly had joined in the chorus with the others
and had grasped many outstretched hands and
smiled and waved her handkerchief and listened
to Otoyo in one ear, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mees Brown, I do like the American
young gentleman veree much,&rdquo; while Judy in
the other was saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it glorious fun? I never saw you
look better. I have a dozen compliments for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The car fairly crept back to Wellington, so
it seemed to poor Molly. At last they arrived
and a carry-all took them back to the Quadrangle.</p>

<p>Without waiting to explain, she left her suitcase
in the hall and ran to the cloisters. Pausing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
at the door marked &ldquo;E.&nbsp;A. Green,&rdquo; she knocked
urgently.</p>

<p>There was no answer. A door farther down
the corridor was opened and the professor of
French looked out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Green has gone away,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He will not return until after the holidays.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>AN INVITATION AND AN APOLOGY.</small></h2>


<p>Millicent Porter invited Molly to go to New
York with her for the holidays and visit in the
grand Porter mansion. Molly understood it was
a palace filled with tapestries and fine pictures.
Millicent had mentioned all those things casually.
They would go to the theaters and the opera and
ride about in motor cars. But Molly was glad
she had kept her head and declined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some work to do, Millicent,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I appreciate your invitation, but I can&rsquo;t accept
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; exclaimed Millicent, too accustomed
to having her own way to take no for an
answer. &ldquo;Is it clothes?&rdquo; she added. Somehow,
she gave the impression of not being used to
wealth.</p>

<p>Molly hardly felt intimate enough with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to go into the subject of her own poverty and answered
briefly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not entirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Millicent was not famous for generosity and
the basket of red roses sent to Molly on the night
of the junior play had been her one outburst;
but she was determined to have Molly go home
with her at any cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s a question
of clothes, I can arrange that perfectly. My
dresses will fit you if they are lengthened and&mdash;well,
there&rsquo;ll be plenty of clothes. Don&rsquo;t bother
about that. Your yellow dress is good enough
for anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say it was,&rdquo; thought Molly, rather
indignantly. &ldquo;Good enough for the likes of you
or anybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you my mink coat and turban,&rdquo; went
on this munificent young person, &ldquo;and I have a
big black velvet hat that would look awfully well
on you. Now, you must come, please. I want
you to see my studio at the top of the house. To
tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m rather lonesome in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
York. I don&rsquo;t know any girls well, because I&rsquo;ve
never stayed at one school long enough to make
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason of that?&rdquo; asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I always get tired or something,&rdquo; answered
the other carelessly. &ldquo;But say you&rsquo;ll
come, do, please,&rdquo; she went on pathetically. Then,
unable to stifle her grand airs, she said: &ldquo;I
doubt if you have such fine houses as ours in
the south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered Molly, quickly, &ldquo;I doubt
if we have. Our homes are very old and simple.
The only works of art are family portraits. We
have no tapestry or statuary. The house I was
born in,&rdquo; she went on half-smiling to herself,
&ldquo;was built by my great-grandfather. Most of
the furniture came down from him, too. Some
of it&rsquo;s quite decrepit now, but we keep it polished
up. My earliest recollection is rubbing the
mahogany. You would doubtless think our
house very empty and plain. We have some old
crimson damask curtains in the parlor, but the
rest of the curtains are made of ten-cent dimity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
There is no furnace. We depend on coal fires
in the bedrooms and wood fires in the other rooms
and we nearly freeze if there&rsquo;s a cold winter.
We have no plumbing. Every member of the
family has his own tub and there are six extra
ones for company. A little colored boy named
Sam brings us hot water every morning for our
baths. He gets it from a big boiler attached to
the kitchen stove, and when we are done bathing
he has to carry it all down again. Rather a nuisance,
isn&rsquo;t it? But Sam doesn&rsquo;t mind. Oh, I
daresay you&rsquo;d think our house was a kind of a
hovel.&rdquo; Molly paused and looked at Millicent
strangely. There was a hidden fire in her deep
blue eyes. &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no palace
in all New York or anywhere else could be as
beautiful to me as my home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Millicent looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it ever so homely, there&rsquo;s no face like one&rsquo;s
own,&rdquo; cried Judy, who at that moment had come
into the room and caught Molly&rsquo;s last words.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this talk about home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just telling Millicent about the old-fashioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
whitewashed brick palace wherein I was
born,&rdquo; answered Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you won&rsquo;t accept my invitation,&rdquo;
said Millicent, taking no notice of Judy whatever.
&ldquo;Perhaps, after you think about it awhile
you&rsquo;ll change your mind.&rdquo; Her manner was
heavy and patronizing, and implied without
words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you have had time to consider the honor
I am paying you and the advantages of visiting
in my splendid home, you cannot fail to accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, Millicent, but I shall not
reconsider it,&rdquo; announced Molly coldly. &ldquo;I have
made up my mind to spend Christmas right here
in the Quadrangle. I hope you&rsquo;ll have a beautiful
time. Good-bye.&rdquo; They shook hands formally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to see the best in her,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather not see it at close hand. She
grates on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy waved an open letter with a dramatic
gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, dearest, I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t accept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
It&rsquo;s my own selfish pleasure that makes
me glad, but I&rsquo;m going to spend Christmas right
here in the Quadrangle, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly looked at her friend&rsquo;s eager, excited face
in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean your mother and father are
coming here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. They&rsquo;re on the Pacific Coast, you
know, and will be detained until spring. It&rsquo;s
too far for me to take the trip just for the few
days I could spend with them, so I&rsquo;m going to
stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A year ago Judy would have been in the depths
of despair over a separation from her beloved
parents at this holiday time. But whether she
had gained poise by her recent sufferings or
whether spending Christmas with her friend in
the big empty Quadrangle appealed to her romantic
nature, it would be difficult to tell. Through
all the complexities of her nature her devotion
to Molly was interwoven like a silver thread, and
the shame and remorse she still felt in looking
back on that unhappy evening when she had denounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
her friend only seemed to draw the two
girls more closely together.</p>

<p>Molly gave her a joyous hug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judy, I am so happy. I never dreamed
of such a blessing as this. Even Otoyo is going
away this year and hardly half a dozen girls
are left in the Quadrangle. I am truly glad I
had the courage to decline Millicent&rsquo;s invitation.
It was only for one instant I was tempted to go,
but she ruined it by a patronizing speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a singular little creature she is,&rdquo; observed
Judy. &ldquo;She has no charm, if she can beat
on silver; and she&rsquo;s so awfully conscious of her
wealth. I don&rsquo;t know how I could ever have admired
her. I suppose I was lured in the beginning
by her fine clothes and her grand way of
talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is very talented,&rdquo; Molly continued, &ldquo;but,
as you say, she lacks charm. Perhaps she would
have been different if she had been poor and
obliged to turn her gifts to some use. After
all, I think we are happier than rich girls. We
are not afraid to be ourselves. We wear old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
clothes and we have an object in view when we
work, because we want to earn money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Earn money,&rdquo; repeated Judy. &ldquo;I only wish
I could give papa the surprise of his life by earning
a copper cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was silent. Her own earning capacity
had not been great that winter. She had kept
herself in pin money by tutoring, but lately she
had made an alarming discovery. When she had
first started to college, teaching had been the ultimate
goal of her ambitions. She intended to be
a teacher in a private school and perhaps later
have a school of her own, as Nance wished to do.</p>

<p>Now, as her horizon broadened and her tastes
and perceptions began taking form and shape,
she found herself drifting farther and farther
away from her early ambition. Something was
waking up in her mind that had been asleep. It
was like a voice crying to be heard, still immensely
far away and inarticulate, but growing clearer
and more insistent all the time.</p>

<p>It made her uneasy and unsettled. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
yearned to express herself, but the power had
not yet arrived.</p>

<p>The two girls went down to the village that
afternoon to see the last trainload of students
pull out of Wellington station, and later to make
some purchases at the general store. It was
Christmas Eve and the streets were filled with
shoppers from the country around Wellington.
Molly was trying to recall the words of a poem
she had heard ages back, the rhythm of which
was beating in her head, and Judy was endeavoring
to explain to herself why she felt neither
homesick nor blue on this the first Christmas ever
spent away from her parents.</p>

<p>They paused to look in at the window of a
florist who did a thriving business in Wellington.
A motor car was waiting in front of the shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must have some Christmas decorations,
too,&rdquo; exclaimed Judy about to enter, when the
way was blocked by a crowd of people coming
out. &ldquo;What pretty girls!&rdquo; continued Judy in a
whisper, looking admiringly at two young women
who came first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The prettiest one, who had red hair not unlike
Molly&rsquo;s and brown eyes, called over her shoulder:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edwin, I shan&rsquo;t save you a seat beside me
unless you&rsquo;re there to claim it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there, Alice, never fear,&rdquo; answered
Professor Green, hurrying after her with an armload
of holly and cedar garlands.</p>

<p>Molly stood rooted to the spot while the shoppers
crowded into the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only tell him how sorry I am for
that cruel speech,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>With a sudden determination, she rushed toward
the car, calling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl named Alice looked around quickly,
but apparently she did not choose to see Molly,
and as the car moved off she began laughing and
talking in a very sprightly and vivacious manner.</p>

<p>Molly sighed. The longer an apology is delayed
the more trivial and insignificant it becomes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He probably has forgotten all about it,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;He seems happy enough with Alice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
whoever she is. Perhaps what I said hurt me
more than it did him, but, oh, I do wish I had
seen him before he went away. It would have
been different then, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She followed Judy into the flower store. Mrs.
McLean was there with Andy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here are two lassies left over!&rdquo; cried
the good woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What luck, mother!&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Now
we&rsquo;ll have some fun. We&rsquo;ll give a dinner and
a dance, and Larry and Dodo will come over.
We will, won&rsquo;t we, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a coaxer you are, Andy. You&rsquo;re still
a lad of ten and not nineteen, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you let him persuade you to give parties
when you&rsquo;re not of a mind to do it, Mrs.
McLean,&rdquo; put in Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss the chance, my dear. I like
it as much as he does. We&rsquo;ll have it to-morrow
night and you&rsquo;ll come prepared to be as merry
as can be and cheer up the doctor. He has been
so busy of late he has forgotten how to enjoy
himself.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look as if we were going to spend
such a quiet Christmas after all, Judy,&rdquo; laughed
Molly, when Mrs. McLean and Andy had gone.</p>

<p>Judy was engaged in selecting all the most
branching and leafy boughs of holly she could
find, while the florist looked on uneasily.</p>

<p>That afternoon they spent an hour beautifying
their yellow sitting room. And all the time
Molly&rsquo;s mind was harking back to Christmas a
year ago, when the Greens had busied themselves
preparing such a delightful party for Otoyo and
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I said he was not a loyal friend,&rdquo; she
said to herself. &ldquo;Oh, if I could only unsay those
words!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat down at her desk and seized a pen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked an inner
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to write a note and tell him I&rsquo;m
sorry, and then I&rsquo;m going over to the cloisters
and slip it under his door. It will ease my mind,
even if he doesn&rsquo;t get the note until he comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
back. He&rsquo;ll know then that I couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep
Christmas Eve until I had apologized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The note finished, she carefully addressed and
sealed it. Judy was in her own room composing
a joint letter to her mother and father, and did
not see Molly when she slipped out of the room
and hurried downstairs. Outside, the pale winter
twilight still lingered and the sky was piled high
with fleecy white clouds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to snow,&rdquo; thought Molly, as she
hurried along the arcade and opened the little
oak door leading into the cloisters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>A CHRISTMAS GHOST STORY THAT WAS NEVER TOLD.</small></h2>


<p>It was quite dark in the corridor whereon
opened the cloister offices. All the teachers had
gone away for the holidays and the place was
as ghostly as a deserted monastery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d like to be here alone on a dark
night, if it is such a young cloister. It seems
to have been born old like some children,&rdquo; Molly
thought.</p>

<p>She coughed and the sound reverberated in
the arched ceiling and came back to her an empty
echo.</p>

<p>Pausing at Professor Green&rsquo;s door, she stooped
to shove the note underneath, when, to her surprise,
the door opened at her touch and swung
lightly back.</p>

<p>With an exclamation, Molly started back, leaving
the note on the floor. Leaning against one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of the deep silled windows, just where the fast
fading light fell across his face, stood a tall,
stoop-shouldered man. In the flashing glimpse
Molly caught of him before she turned and fled,
she noticed that he resembled an old gray eagle
with a thin beak of a nose and a worn white
face; and that his dark eyes were quite close together.
The rest of him was lost in the black
shadows of the room.</p>

<p>Once out of the ghostly corridor and the heavy
oak door shut between her and the strange visitor
in the Professor&rsquo;s office, Molly paused and
took a deep breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of goodness,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what
have I just seen? If he had stirred or blinked
an eyelash or even appeared to breathe, I should
at least have felt he was human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big empty hall of the Quadrangle seemed
a cheerful spot in comparison with the cloister
corridor. It was warm and light and from the
seniors&rsquo; parlor came the sound of piano playing.
But Molly never paused to look in and see what
belated student was cheering herself with music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Only her own sitting room with its gay holiday
decorations and Judy twanging the guitar could
recall her to a world of realities. Before she
reached the door she had made up her mind that
it would be just as well not to tell the excitable
and impressionable Judy anything about the apparition
or whatever it was in the Professor&rsquo;s
study. It was really an act of self-denial, because
it would have been decidedly interesting to discuss
the episode with Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have told Nance,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;She
would have agreed with me, I am sure, that it
couldn&rsquo;t have been a ghost because, of course,
there are no such things. But if I tell Judy, I
know perfectly well she will persuade me it was
a ghost and we&rsquo;ll be frightened to death all
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy, still wearing her widow&rsquo;s weeds, was
singing a doleful ballad when Molly hurried in,
called &ldquo;By the Bonnie Milldams o&rsquo; Binnorie.&rdquo;
Molly was fond of this ancient song, but she was
in no mood to listen to it just then.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;The youngest stood upon a stane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eldest cam&rsquo; and pushed her in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, sister, sister, reach your hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye sall be heir to half my land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, sister, sister, reach but your glove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet William sall be your love.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The guitar gave out a mournful twang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk about impressionable people, I&rsquo;m worse
than she is,&rdquo; thought Molly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shriek aloud
if she doesn&rsquo;t stop this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the six o&rsquo;clock bell boomed out and
Molly did give a loud nervous exclamation.</p>

<p>Judy dropped the guitar on the floor. The
strings resounded with a deep protesting chord
and then subsided into resigned quietude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, what is the matter? You&rsquo;re as pale as
a ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly smiled at her own weakness. Having
just made up her mind not to tell Judy, she was
suddenly possessed with a fever to relate the entire
incident from beginning to end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll promise to put on your red dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to-night by way of celebration, and to cheer me
up, I&rsquo;ll tell you a thrilling story, Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve made a vow and I can&rsquo;t break it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the vow stipulate that you couldn&rsquo;t wear
colors Christmas Eve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, get into your scarlet frock, because
I&rsquo;ll never tell you if you wear that black
one, and I&rsquo;ll put on some old gay-colored rag, too,
and after supper I&rsquo;ll tell you a thrilling tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put on the red dress,&rdquo; said Judy, &ldquo;if you
promise never to tell Nance, but I can&rsquo;t wait until
after supper to hear the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to. It&rsquo;s a long tale and there won&rsquo;t
be time to dress and tell it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; consented Judy, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s Christmas
Eve, the very time to tell thrilling tales if
they are true, I&rsquo;ll agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And obediently she attired herself in the scarlet
dress, while Molly put on a blue blouse that, by
a happy chance, matched the color of her eyes as
perfectly as if they had been cut from the same
bolt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it really happen to me,&rdquo; she kept thinking,
&ldquo;or did I dream it after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no chance to tell Judy the story
after supper, because the two girls were summoned
to the parlor almost immediately to see
three callers, Andy, Dodo Green and Lawrence
Upton.</p>

<p>During the visit Molly seized the opportunity
to ask the younger Green where his brother was
spending his Christmas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s making visits around the county,&rdquo;
answered George Theodore carelessly. &ldquo;He always
has enough invitations for three, but he
was never known to accept any before. I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s got into the old boy this year. He&rsquo;s
getting as giddy as a débutante, going to parties
and rushing around in motors. I have had to
make two trips over to Wellington, first to get
his evening clothes because he forgot to pack
them, and then for his pumps and dress shirts
I forgot myself. When the old boy goes into
anything, he always does it in good style. He
used to be a kind of dude about ten years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
But he&rsquo;s all the way to thirty now and he feels
his age. Do you notice how bald he&rsquo;s getting?
He&rsquo;ll be losing his teeth next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s having such a good time,&rdquo; said
Molly, disdaining the aspersions cast by George
Theodore on his brother&rsquo;s age. &ldquo;I hope he is
well and happy,&rdquo; she added in her thoughts. &ldquo;I
am sure I don&rsquo;t begrudge him a jolly Christmas,
considering what a jolly one he gave me last year.
I am sorry I left the note, now. Like as not, he
doesn&rsquo;t even remember what I said that day and
when he reads the letter he won&rsquo;t know what I
am talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the boys left. Judy was intensely relieved.
She desired only one thing on earth: to
hear Molly&rsquo;s ghost story. All her perceptions
were on edge with curiosity, but she was determined
to have all things in harmony for the telling
of a Christmas Eve Ghost Story. So she
restrained her inquisitiveness until they had
slipped on dressing-gowns and were both comfortably
installed in big chairs with a box of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
candy and a plate of salted almonds between
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, begin,&rdquo; she said, sighing comfortably.</p>

<p>But Molly had scarcely uttered three words
when she was interrupted by the arrival of packages
from the late train brought up by the faithful
Murphy.</p>

<p>Even Judy&rsquo;s unsatisfied curiosity regarding the
tale could not hold out against these fascinating
boxes, and the story waited while they untied the
strings and eagerly tore off the paper wrappings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we ought to wait until to-morrow
morning, but since we&rsquo;re just two lonely little
waifs, I think we might gratify ourselves this
once, don&rsquo;t you, Molly dear?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; Molly agreed, &ldquo;seeing as it
doesn&rsquo;t matter to anybody whether we look at
them now or in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a long time before they settled down
again to the story, and Molly had not advanced
a paragraph when there came another tap at the
door. Evidently the Quadrangle gates were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
be kept open late that night or account of the
arrival of holiday packages.</p>

<p>This time it was a boy from the florist&rsquo;s, fairly
laden with flower boxes.</p>

<p>Andy had sent both the girls violets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sweet and proper of him, I&rsquo;m sure, in
the absence of Nance,&rdquo; laughed Judy.</p>

<p>Lawrence Upton had sent Molly a box of
American beauties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he could ill afford it, the foolish boy,&rdquo;
ejaculated Molly.</p>

<p>Dodo had expended all his savings on a handsome
Jerusalem cherry tree for Judy. There was
another box for Molly. It contained violets and
two cards&mdash;Miss Grace Green&rsquo;s and Professor
Edwin Green&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Molly blushed crimson when she read the
names. For the thousandth time she covered herself
with reproaches. She sat down and gathered
the bouquets into her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy,&rdquo; she cried contritely, &ldquo;what have I done
to gain all these kind friends? I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
deserve it. The dears!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>But Judy was too much engaged with her own
numerous gifts to contradict this self-depreciating
statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am really happy, Molly,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;even
without mamma and papa it&rsquo;s been a lovely
Christmas Eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one of those divinations which sometimes
comes to us like a voice from another land, it suddenly
occurred to Molly that whatever it was in
Professor Green&rsquo;s office, whether ghost or human,
perhaps the Professor might not like to have it
discussed, and she resolved not to tell Judy or
anyone else what she had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;if he ever asks me
whether I told, it will be a nice, comfortable feeling
to say I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, having put the flowers back in the
boxes and restored some order to the room, Judy
sat down and folded her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, go on with the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child, so much has happened since
then and I&rsquo;m so weary, I don&rsquo;t think I can make
it the frightful tale I had intended.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was all a joke?&rdquo; asked Judy, whose enthusiasm
had about spent itself in other outlets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, partly a joke. I went down to the cloisters
to leave a Christmas note for Professor
Green at his office and saw a ghostly looking figure
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all? Well, anybody might look like
a phantom in that gloomy place. I&rsquo;ve no doubt
the ghostly figure took you for another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt it did,&rdquo; answered Molly, laughing,
and with that they kissed and went to bed.</p>

<p>Long after midnight Molly rose and slipped
on her dressing-gown. Creeping out of her room,
she flitted along the corridor, turned the corner
and hurried up the other side of the Quadrangle.
At the very end of this hall was a narrow passage
with a window which commanded a view
of the courtyard and the windows of the cloister
studies.</p>

<p>Softly raising the blind, she looked out. In one
of the studies a dim light was burning. She
counted windows. It was Professor Green&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
office, she was certain. While she looked the
light went out.</p>

<p>Back to her bed she flew with a feeling that
somebody was chasing her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing certain,&rdquo; she thought, drawing
the covers over her head, &ldquo;ghosts never need
lights.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>MORE CHRISTMAS PRESENTS AND A COASTING
PARTY OF TWO.</small></h2>


<p>All the bells in Wellington were ringing when
the girls awoke Christmas morning. The sweet-toned
bell of the Chapel of St. Francis mingled
its notes with the persistent appeal of the Roman
Catholic bell across the way, while on the next
street the bell of the Presbyterian Church sent
out a calm doctrinal call for all repentant sinners
to be on hand sharp for the ten o&rsquo;clock service.
And in this confusion of sound came the tinkle
of sleigh bells like a note of pleasure in a religious
symphony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; cried Judy, running into
the room with an armful of parcels done up with
white tissue paper and tied with red ribbons.
&ldquo;Here are the presents Nance and the others left
for you. &lsquo;My lady fair, arise, arise, arise!&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; cried Molly, bounding
out of bed and rushing to find the presents she
had been commissioned to take care of for Judy.</p>

<p>The two girls climbed under the covers and
began to open their gifts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old Nance!&rdquo; ejaculated Judy. &ldquo;How
well she knows my wants. She&rsquo;s given me an
address book because she disapproved of my
keeping addresses on old envelopes.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="molly003" id="molly003"></a>
<img src="images/molly003.jpg" width="400" height="588" alt="&ldquo;AND SHE&rsquo;S GIVEN ME A PAIR OF SILK STOCKINGS,&rdquo; CRIED
MOLLY.&mdash;Page&nbsp;213." title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;AND SHE&rsquo;S GIVEN ME A PAIR OF SILK STOCKINGS,&rdquo; CRIED
MOLLY.&mdash;<i>Page&nbsp;213.</i></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s given me a pair of silk stockings,&rdquo;
cried Molly, &ldquo;because she knows my luxurious
tastes run to such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edith Williams is the class joker,&rdquo; remarked
Judy, laughing. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sent me a novel by Black
and she&rsquo;s written on the fly leaf, &lsquo;For the first
six months the Merry Widow read only novels
by Black.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t they dears?&rdquo; broke in Molly. &ldquo;They
knew we&rsquo;d be lonely and they wanted to make
us laugh Christmas morning. Look what Edith
sent me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a small round basket of sweet grass,
no doubt purchased at the village store, and inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
on pink cotton was a pasteboard medal.
Printed around the outer edge of the medal was
the following announcement: &ldquo;Awarded to
Pallas Athene Brown for the Best General Average
in Good Manners and Amiability by the Wellington
High School.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hole punched in one end of the
medal with a blue ribbon run through it. On
one of Edith&rsquo;s cards in the box was written:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be worn on great occasions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls received other amusing presents.
If their friends had hoped to cheer them on their
lonely Christmas morning, they had succeeded
wonderfully well. Judy especially was in the
wildest spirits. It was a custom of hers to describe
her feelings exactly as a chronic invalid
recounts his sensations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all aglow with good cheer. I could dance
and sing. It must be a sort of Christmas spirit
in the air. I do adore to get presents. I think
I have more curiosity in my nature than you,
Molly. Why don&rsquo;t you open the rest of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was lost in admiration of a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
little copy of Maeterlinck&rsquo;s &ldquo;<cite>Pelléas et Mélisande</cite>&rdquo;
sent to her by Mary Stewart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I like to eat my cake slowly,&rdquo; she
answered, &ldquo;and get all the fine flavor without
choking myself to death. Oh,&rdquo; she cried, taking
the tissue paper off a small parcel, &ldquo;how lovely
of your mother, Judy, to send me this beautiful
lace collar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like the one she sent me,&rdquo; answered
Judy, as pleased as a child over Molly&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
&ldquo;But do look in the other boxes. What&rsquo;s
that square thing? If it were mine, I should be
palpitating with curiosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Judy had guessed what the square box contained,
she would not have been so eager to precipitate
an embarrassing situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mistress Judy, we&rsquo;ll find out immediately
what&rsquo;s inside. Where did it come
from, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not the slightest inkling of who sent
it,&rdquo; answered Judy, examining the address printed
in a sort of script. &ldquo;Whoever sent it knew how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to do lettering, certainly. But the postmark is
smeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly cut the string and removed the brown
paper wrapping. The article inside the box was
folded in a quantity of tissue paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has as many coverings as a royal Egyptian
mummy,&rdquo; exclaimed Judy impatiently.</p>

<p>It had indeed. After stripping off several
layers of paper it was necessary to cut another
string before the rest of the paper could be removed.</p>

<p>At last, however, another china Martin Luther
emerged from his tissue paper shell. The two
girls gasped with surprise and consternation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will wonders never cease?&rdquo; ejaculated Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just another joke the girls are
playing on us,&rdquo; broke in Judy with some excitement.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a card. What does it say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On a pasteboard card, written in the same
script as the address, was the following mystifying
message:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it kind to put such temptation in the
way of the weak?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it mean, Judy?&rdquo; asked Molly. &ldquo;I
seem to be groping in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can search me,&rdquo; she said expressively.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you break a hole in him and see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No sooner said than done,&rdquo; answered Molly.
&ldquo;But I really feel like a butcher. This is the third
time I&rsquo;ve destroyed a pig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cracked the bank on the head of her little
iron bed, but only a silver quarter rolled out on
the floor. The rest of the money was in bills,
three five dollar bills, which had been compactly
folded and pushed through the slit in the pig&rsquo;s
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen dollars and a quarter!&rdquo; ejaculated
Molly. &ldquo;That was just about what the original
sum was, but I suppose in silver it was too heavy
to come through the mails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lay back on her pillows, her brows
wrinkled into a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious performance,&rdquo; she said, after a
brief silence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy at the foot of the bed, half buried in tissue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
paper and Christmas presents, glanced out
of the window at the snowy landscape. There
was a strange expression on her face and two
little imps of laughter lurked in her wide gray
eyes. Molly looked at her a moment, but Judy
would not meet her gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Julia Kean,&rdquo; broke out Molly, suddenly, &ldquo;do
you know whom you look like this moment?
Mona Lisa. You have the same mysterious smile
as if you knew a great deal more than you intended
to tell. Now just turn around and look
me in the eyes.&rdquo; Molly crawled from under the
covers and put her hands on her friend&rsquo;s
shoulders. &ldquo;Who sent me that first Martin
Luther with all the small change?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy&rsquo;s lips curled into an irresistible smile.
There was something very mellowed and soft
about her face, like an old portrait, the colors
of which had deepened with the years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t angry with me, Molly, dearest?&rdquo;
she asked, laying her cheek against Molly&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angry? How could I be angry, you adorable
child?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You see it was just taking money out of one
pocket to put it in the other, and it was the only
way I could think of to make you take the yellow
dress. You wouldn&rsquo;t accept it as a gift. Of
course, I never dreamed the real thief would repent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two friends looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes
with loving confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old Judy!&rdquo; cried Molly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what I have done to deserve such a friend as
you. And what an imagination you have! Who
but you would ever have conceived such a notion?
And to think, too, that I would never have known,
if the real person who took the money hadn&rsquo;t
had an attack of conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would certainly have remained a secret forever
unless Nance had confessed it on her death
bed,&rdquo; laughed Judy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s that close, I imagine
her first confession would be her last one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear the dress to-night, Judy, just to
show you how much I appreciate the gift,&rdquo; announced
Molly.</p>

<p>Judy put on a broad lace collar that morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and a lavender velvet bow, by way of lightening
her mourning.</p>

<p>There was a good deal to do during the day,
getting the rooms straightened and writing
letters.</p>

<p>All morning the snow fell so softly and quietly
that the Quadrangle seemed to be isolated in a
still white world of its own. Not even the campus
houses could be seen through the thick curtain
of flakes. Molly could picture to herself
no more delightful occupation than to stay indoors
all day and read one of her new Christmas
books. Nothing could have been more cheerful
than the little sitting room with its Christmas
greens and vases of flowers.</p>

<p>Curled up in one of the big chairs, Molly&rsquo;s
mind wandered idly from the open pages of the
book in her lap to the recent inexplicable happenings.
Who was the mysterious visitor in the
Professor&rsquo;s study? After all, it was none of her
business, but she felt some natural curiosity
about it. Who was the girl who had stolen the
china pig?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know,&rdquo; she admonished herself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was impossible not to make a
few random conjectures.</p>

<p>Judy, restlessly beating a tattoo on the window,
was thinking the same thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; she burst out, after a long silence,
&ldquo;I have an idea who that girl is. Have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;d rather not mention her name.
It&rsquo;s too dreadful. And you know how I feel
about circumstantial evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I say is,&rdquo; announced Judy, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s a
certain person who makes the loudest noise about
losing her own things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s repented,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;so let&rsquo;s
try and forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another brief but eloquent silence.
Judy pressed her face against the window pane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did think,&rdquo; she observed presently, &ldquo;that
those boys would come to take us out for a sleigh
ride or a coast or something this afternoon. But
we can&rsquo;t wait around here all day for them. It
would be paying them too much of an honor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Why not go coasting ourselves? I&rsquo;ll get Edith&rsquo;s
sled and we&rsquo;ll walk over to Round Head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be fine,&rdquo; said Molly, with all the
enthusiasm she could muster. Reluctantly she
laid aside her book and began to dress for the
walk.</p>

<p>When two intimate associates are not mutually
agreed, the more selfish one never dreams of the
sacrifices of the other. Molly had no taste for
battling with the snow, and when in half an
hour they found themselves plunging through
the drifts on their way to the steep coasting hill,
she turned a wistful inward eye back toward the
comforts of the yellow-walled sitting room. The
Morris chair, the prized antique rug and the
Japanese scroll with the snow-capped Fujiyama
and the sky-blue waters called to her insistently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this glorious, Molly?&rdquo; ejaculated Judy,
fired with the energy of her enthusiasms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dee-lightful,&rdquo; replied poor Molly, brushing
the snow out of her eyes with admirable pretense
at cheerfulness. However, the snowfall began
to diminish and when they reached Round Head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the storm had apparently spent itself. Molly
felt the glow of exercise she really needed and
she admired the splendid panorama of the snow-clad
valley stretching before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;and what fun,
Judy, to go whizzing down Round Head! It will
be the longest coast I have ever taken in my
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clambering up the side of the hill had not been
as difficult as they had expected, because the
wind had swept that part of it clear of drifts
and the way was plain. When at last they
reached the top, Molly was no longer sorry that
Judy had dragged her from &ldquo;The Idylls of the
King&rdquo; and the comforts of an easy chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid, Molly?&rdquo; asked the reckless
Judy, looking with the glittering eye of anticipation
down the long track of white over
which they would presently be flying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should be,&rdquo; answered Molly
evasively. &ldquo;Even if we fall off, it will be on
a bed of snow as soft as a down comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; cried Judy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the sensation of our lives. And we might as
well make it a good one, because it&rsquo;s beginning
to snow again and we&rsquo;d better not try it a second
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy had coasted down Round Head before
and knew just the spot on the hill where the
Wellington girls were accustomed to start the
long slide on bobs and sleds.</p>

<p>Sitting behind Judy, Molly closed her eyes and
the sled commenced its journey. For some moments
it skimmed along at a reasonable speed,
but as it gained in impetus, she had the sensation
of riding on the tail of a comet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for the bump,&rdquo; called Judy with
amazing calm and forethought, considering the
circumstances.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="molly004" id="molly004"></a>
<img src="images/molly004.jpg" width="400" height="556" alt="THE NEXT THING SHE KNEW SHE WAS BURIED DEEP IN A SNOW
DRIFT, AND JUDY WAS WHIZZING ON ALONE.&mdash;Page&nbsp;224" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">THE NEXT THING SHE KNEW SHE WAS BURIED DEEP IN A SNOW
DRIFT, AND JUDY WAS WHIZZING ON ALONE.&mdash;<i>Page&nbsp;224</i></span>
</div>

<p>But the warning had no meaning for Molly,
whose experience in coasting was of a very mild
and unexciting character. The shock of the rise
caused her to lose her hold, and the next thing
she knew she was buried deep in a snow drift
and Judy was whizzing on alone into the unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did really enjoy coasting,&rdquo; thought
Molly, climbing out of the drift and shaking herself
vigorously like a wet dog. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right
if nothing happens, but something always does
happen and then it&rsquo;s a regular nuisance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Already the tracks of the sled were covered
by the fast falling snow and it was impossible
to see just where the tumble had occurred on
the hillside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy,&rdquo; called Molly, hurrying down the hill;
while at the same moment Judy was calling
Molly as she hastened back.</p>

<p>The two girls passed each other at no great
distance apart, but they might have been as
widely separated as the poles for all they could
see or hear in the blinding snowstorm.</p>

<p>After calling and searching in vain, Judy
started back to Wellington, feeling sure that her
friend had gone that way; and Molly, who was
gifted with no bump of location whatever, blindly
groping in the snowstorm turned in the opposite
direction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>THE WAYFARERS.</small></h2>


<p>Human beings have been variously compared
by imaginative persons to pawns on a chessboard;
storm-tossed boats on the sea of life; pilgrims
on a weary way, and other things of no resemblance
whatever to the foregoing.</p>

<p>Molly, marching stoically along the lonely
road under the impression that she was on her
way to Wellington when she was really turned
toward Exmoor, might have fitted into any of
those comparisons rather more literally than was
intended.</p>

<p>She was certainly a storm-tossed pilgrim if
not a boat; the way was decidedly weary and as
pawn, pilgrim or ship, whichever you will, she
was about to come in contact with another of
life&rsquo;s pawns, pilgrims or ships, to the decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
advantage of the one and amazement of the
other.</p>

<p>This new pawn, pilgrim or ship was now advancing
down the road, and Molly, mindful of
the fact that she was not getting anywhere when
she felt sure that by this time she should at least
have reached the lake, was not sorry to see a
human being.</p>

<p>The stranger looked decidedly like the pilgrim
of romance. He wore an old black felt hat with
a broad slouching brim and a long Spanish cape
reaching below his knees; his staff was a rosewood
cane with a silver knob.</p>

<p>He was about to pass Molly without even
glancing in her direction when she stopped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind telling me if it&rsquo;s very far
from Wellington?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine you are going to Wellington?&rdquo;
he demanded, looking up.</p>

<p>Instantly Molly recognized him. He was the
man she had seen the night before in Professor
Green&rsquo;s study.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I did think so,&rdquo; she answered meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would advise you to go in the opposite direction,
then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Exmoor lies that way.&rdquo;
He pointed down the road with his stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly. &ldquo;I
was coasting and tumbled off the sled. I was
completely dazed, I suppose, when I crawled out
of the drift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two walked along in silence. Molly gave
the man a covert glance. He was very distinguished
looking and vaguely reminded her of
someone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are one of the students of Wellington?&rdquo;
he asked presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Molly respectfully.</p>

<p>The stranger smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are from the south. I never heard a
girl across the boundary line use &lsquo;sir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she answered briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And from what part, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Carmichael Station, Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man stopped as if he had been struck a
blow in the face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Carmichael Station, Kentucky,&rdquo; he repeated
in a half whisper. Drawing a leather wallet from
his inside pocket, he took out a folded legal cap
document and opened it. &ldquo;Ahem. Not far to
go,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, running down a list
with one finger. &ldquo;Your name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mildred Carmichael Brown, I presume.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mary. My sister&rsquo;s named Mildred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man refolded the document, put it
carefully back in the wallet, which he returned
to his pocket. Then he resumed his walk, muttering
to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange! Strange!&rdquo; Molly heard him say.
&ldquo;Here in a snowstorm, in the wilderness, on
Christmas day, too, I should happen to meet&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t get away from them,&rdquo; he cried angrily,
waving his cane. &ldquo;Victims, victims! Everywhere.
They rise up and confront me when I&rsquo;m
sleeping or waking&mdash;like ghosts of the past&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mutterings gradually became inarticulate
as he wrapped his cape around him and stalked
through the snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hunted&mdash;hunted&mdash;hounded about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began
again. Suddenly he stopped, took off his hat
and held his face up to heaven as if he were about
to address some unseen power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of
these wanderings; these eternal haunting visions.
Let me have peace!&rdquo; He shook his cane impotently
at the overcast skies.</p>

<p>It was then that Molly recognized him. On
that very day but one, a year ago, had she not seen
Judith Blount stand under a wintry sky and defy
heaven in the same rebellious way?</p>

<p>Judith&rsquo;s father had come back from South
America and was hiding in the Professor&rsquo;s room
at Wellington! And how like they were, the father
and daughter; the same black eyes, too close
together; the same handsome aquiline noses, and
the same self-pitying, brooding natures.</p>

<p>Evidently, Mr. Blount had suffered deeply.
Molly thought he must be very poor. Looking
at him closely, she noticed the shabby gentility of
his appearance; the shiny seams of his Spanish
cape which had been torn and patched in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
places; his old thin shoes, split across the toes,
and his worn, travel-stained hat.</p>

<p>She wondered if he had any money. She suspected
that he was very hungry and her soul was
moved with pity for the poor, broken old man who
had once been worth millions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blount,&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know my name?&rdquo; he cried, shivering
all over like a whipped dog. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mention
it, did I? I haven&rsquo;t told any one, have I?
I came down here in disguise.&rdquo; He laughed
feebly. &ldquo;Disguised as a broken old man. I went
to Edwin&rsquo;s rooms,&rdquo; he wandered on, forgetting
that he had asked Molly a question. &ldquo;You know
where they are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly nodded her head. She knew quite well
that the Professor lodged in one of the former
college houses built on the old campus, used long
ago before the Quadrangle had been built flanking
the new campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The housekeeper recognized me as a relation
and I waited in his room some hours,&rdquo; went on
the old man in a trembling voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And where did you spend the night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the cloister study. I found the key on his
desk. It was marked &lsquo;cloister study.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where did you eat?&rdquo; asked Molly gently.</p>

<p>The melting sympathy in her eyes and voice
encouraged the old man to pour out his woes.
Evidently it was a great relief to him to talk after
his miseries and hardships.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living off apples,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Very
fine apples. There was a big basket of them on
Edwin&rsquo;s study table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s an inn in the village,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come all the way from Caracas to Wellington,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I was poor when I started;
yes, miserably, wretchedly poor. I am an old
man, old and broken. I want peace, do you understand?
Peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached the lake and in fifteen minutes
would arrive at the Quadrangle. Mr. Blount
was leading the way, occasionally hitting the
ground savagely with his cane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly thrust her hand into her blouse and
drew out a chamois skin bag which hung by a
silk tape around her neck. Since the pilfering
had been going on at Wellington she carried
what little money she had with her during the
day and hid it under her pillow at night.</p>

<p>Extracting ten dollars from the bag, she hurried
to the old man&rsquo;s side and touched him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blount, I&rsquo;m under great obligations to
your cousin. He has been very kind to me&mdash;always&mdash;and
I&rsquo;d like you to&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was difficult to know what to say. Was it
not strange for her, a poor little school girl, to
be offering money to a man who had so recently
been a millionaire?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take this money?&rdquo; she began
again, resolutely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone will recognize
you at the inn. It&rsquo;s just a little country
place and you will be quite comfortable there
until I find Professor Green. I may get word
to him to-night, or to-morrow at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blount eyed the money as a hungry dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
eyes a bone. Evidently hunger and fatigue had
got the better of his pride. He took the bill and
touched it lovingly. Then he put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see George Green?&rdquo; asked
Molly timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; he answered fiercely. &ldquo;Not that
young fool. I don&rsquo;t suppose Judith is here?&rdquo; he
added presently in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. She&rsquo;s in New York for the holidays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They shook hands and separated. Mr. Blount
took the path down the other side of the lake
across the links to the village and Molly followed
the path on the college side. As she cut through
the pine woods she heard a shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly Brown, where have you been? We
have had a search for you!&rdquo; cried Judy, rushing
up, followed by the three boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ve been a good deal like the pig
who thought he was going to Cork when he was
really going to Dublin,&rdquo; laughed Molly. &ldquo;If I
hadn&rsquo;t asked the way, I suppose I&rsquo;d have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
almost to Exmoor by this time. I am a poor person
to find my way about. My brother used to
tell me to take the direction opposite to the one
my instincts told me to take and then I&rsquo;d be going
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words, first make sure you&rsquo;re right
and then take the other way,&rdquo; said Lawrence
Upton, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a good explorer, Miss Molly,&rdquo;
remarked Andy McLean. &ldquo;You might discover
the South Pole and think all the time it was the
North Pole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be of great benefit to humanity,&rdquo;
answered Molly, &ldquo;but you may be sure I&rsquo;d stop
and ask a policeman before I reached the
equator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your proper punishment for cutting
church this morning,&rdquo; here put in George Green.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it was because it was a
good excuse to go sleighing, but a lot of people
were at the ten service. Even old Edwin came
in the trail of Alice Fern.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pretty name!&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;It sounds
so woodsy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a cousin,&rdquo; George went on, &ldquo;and a winner,
too. They&rsquo;ve got a jim-dandy place ten miles
the other side of Wellington, Fern Grove. We
spent last New Year&rsquo;s with them and had a
cracker-jack time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Theodore Green!&rdquo; ejaculated Judy,
&ldquo;I never heard so much slang. I wonder you are
allowed inside Exmoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I cut it out there. I only use it when it&rsquo;s
safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regard that as a slight on present company,&rdquo;
broke in Andy. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll just have
to take a little dose of punishment for that, Dodo.
Get busy, Larrie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a wild scramble in the snow, and
finally Dodo, who had developed into a big, strapping
fellow, stronger than either of his friends,
intrenched himself behind a tree and began
throwing snowballs with the unerring aim of
the best pitcher on the Exmoor team. Molly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
hastened on to the Quadrangle, while Judy with
true sportsman taste waited to see the fun.</p>

<p>Molly went straight to the telephone booths in
the basement corridor. By good fortune, the
haughty being who presided at the switchboard
was hovering about waiting for a long distance
call from a &ldquo;certain party&rdquo; in New York.</p>

<p>That she alone in all the world was concerned
in this call and that she wished to have this corner
of the globe entirely to herself for the full
enjoyment of it were very evident facts when
Molly asked for &ldquo;Fern-16-Wellington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not working to-day,&rdquo; announced the operator
shortly, arranging her huge Psyche knot at
the mirror beside her desk.</p>

<p>Molly looked into the girl&rsquo;s implacable face.
No feminine appeal would melt that heart of
stone, but perhaps the magic name of man might
fix her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you do it to oblige Professor Green?
I have an important message for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; announced the owner
of the Psyche knot, with a high nasal accent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so at first? I guess Professor
Green is about the nicest gent&rsquo;man around
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sitting down at the switchboard, she slipped
on the headpiece with a professional flourish.
Then, with a hand-quicker-than-the-eye movement,
she pushed several organ stops up and
down, stuck the end of a green tube into a hole
and remarked in a high pitched voice that had
great projective powers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wellington Exchange? Hello! Yes, I know
it&rsquo;s Christmas. On hand for a long distance, are
you? Oh, you-u-u. Well, say, listen. To oblige
a certain party&mdash;a very attractive gent&rsquo;man&mdash;call
up &lsquo;Fern-16-Wellington.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a detached monologue about
a certain party in you know where&mdash;same
gent&rsquo;man that was down Thanksgiving time.
Suddenly, with professional alertness, the telephone
girl stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fern-16-Wellington? Here&rsquo;s your party.
Booth 3,&rdquo; she added to Molly, in a voice so radically
different that Molly had a confused feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
that the young person who operated the Wellington
switchboard might be a creature of two personalities.
She retired timidly to the booth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the residence of Miss Alice Fern?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; came the voice of a woman from the
other end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to speak to Professor Edwin
Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very much engaged just now. Is it
important?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is,&rdquo; hesitated Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what earthly difference does it make
to her what my name is?&rdquo; Molly reflected with
some irritation. &ldquo;Would you please tell him it&rsquo;s
a message from the University?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him nothing until you tell me your
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Could this be Miss Alice Fern? Molly was
fairly certain it was. Perhaps she also had two
personalities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t do any good to tell my name. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
have nothing to do with the message. I&rsquo;m only
delivering it for someone else. But if you want
to know, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Brown.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. or Miss Brown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Molly heard the Professor&rsquo;s voice
quite close to the telephone saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice, is that someone for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, an individual of the illuminating name
of Brown wishes to speak to you. I don&rsquo;t see
why they can&rsquo;t leave you alone for one day in
the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly smiled. Why was it that down deep
in the unexplored caverns of her soul there lurked
an infinitesimally tiny feeling of relief that Miss
Alice Fern was plainly a vixen?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Professor Green? This is
Molly Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do? Is anything the matter?&rdquo;
answered the Professor in rather an anxious
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to tell you that Mr. Blount is here.
Old Mr. Blount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Professor seemed too surprised to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
for a moment. Or it might have been that Miss
Alice Fern was lingering at his elbow and embarrassed
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He spent last night in the cloister study.
Now, he&rsquo;s at the inn. He asked me to let you
know. I met him on the road. He&rsquo;s very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did he happen to be in the study?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he had no money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now he&rsquo;s at the inn? Has he seen anyone
but you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Molly blushed hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come right over. Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Edwin, what a nuisance!&rdquo; broke in the
voice of Miss Fern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye. Thank you again. I really must,
Alice. Very impor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The receiver had been hung up and the connection
lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, these cousins!&rdquo; Molly reflected with a
laugh as she hurried up to her room.</p>

<p class="star">**********</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a gay party at the McLeans&rsquo; that
night and one unexpected guest arrived just before
dinner. It was Professor Green. They
squeezed him in somehow at the end of the table
with the doctor, and the two made merry together
like school boys. Molly had never seen
the Professor of English Literature in such joyous
spirits. After dinner, when the dancing commenced,
he sought her out and led her to a secluded
sofa in the back hall. She began at once
by asking about Mr. Blount, but the Professor
was not listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the prettiest dresses I&rsquo;ve seen
you wear,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Yellow is not becoming
to most people, but it is to you. Probably
because it has the same golden quality that&rsquo;s
in your hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it,&rdquo; said Molly, turning red
under his steady gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found your note on my study floor,&rdquo; he
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t remember what
I was talking about, after all,&rdquo; she exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I had to write it. I have never really been
happy since I said that cruel thing to you. I was
so wretched the day afterward, and when I
rushed to find you in your study, you were gone!&rdquo;
she broke off with a tearful glance into his eyes.</p>

<p>The Professor beamed upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you were unhappy,&rdquo; he said, as if the
statement was not entirely unpleasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I know now that you were quite
right to tell Miss Walker about that silly episode
of the burying of the slipper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I never told her. I know the story, of
course, and the explanation. The President told
me herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who did tell, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was now Molly&rsquo;s turn to beam on the Professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you didn&rsquo;t tell her,&rdquo; she exclaimed
in tones of great relief. &ldquo;You see, you didn&rsquo;t
inform on Judith Blount that time, and I was
hurt. I couldn&rsquo;t help from being. I was really
awfully sore.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said the Professor hurriedly,
&ldquo;promise hereafter to regard me as a faithful
friend. Never doubt my sincerity again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; answered Molly, feeling intensely
proud without knowing why.</p>

<p>Then the talk drifted to Mr. Blount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t mentioned meeting him?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Not even to Miss Kean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a very unusual young woman, Miss
Brown. It&rsquo;s important to keep Mr. Blount&rsquo;s
presence here a secret. If word got out that he
had come back, there would be a great hue and
cry in the papers. I have him with me now at
my rooms until Richard gets here. The family
will be very grateful to you for your kindness
to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawrence Upton was coming down the hall to
claim Molly for a dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going back to the Ferns&rsquo; to-morrow?&rdquo;
she asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered the Professor with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the ghost of a smile. &ldquo;I am detained here on
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Molly received a short note
from Professor Green, inclosing a ten dollar bill.</p>

<p>There was a postscript which said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve opened a barrel of greenings. Better
come around and get some.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>HEALING THE BLIND.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;But, Madeleine, I never touched an iron in
my life. I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to go about it,&rdquo;
protested Judith Blount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time you learned then, child. It&rsquo;s
a very useful piece of knowledge, I assure you.
You may begin on handkerchiefs first. They
are easy, just a flat surface, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter
if you scorch one, especially as it&rsquo;s your own.
Test the iron like this, see. Pick it up with the
holder, wet your finger and touch the bottom.
If it gives out a sizzly sound, it&rsquo;s fairly hot and
may be used on something damp. It will surely
scorch dry material. Always sprinkle. Rough-dry
things can&rsquo;t be ironed decently unless they
have been sprinkled and allowed to get damp
through and through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeleine Petit&rsquo;s unceasing flow of conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
did not stop while Judith took her first lesson
in ironing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Madeleine, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made
quite a name for myself for doing up fine things
and I really need an assistant, Judith. And,
since you need the money, and I like you better
than any girl in college, I want you to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith winced at the mention of poverty, but
her face softened when Madeleine spoke of
friendship.</p>

<p>After all, was it not good to have a friend, a
real tried and devoted friend who had nothing
to gain but friendship in return? Yes, Madeleine
did talk a great deal. We all have our
faults. Judith&rsquo;s was a temper. She knew that.
But Madeleine was good company, nevertheless,
much better company than those false friends of
Beta Phi days. She was charming and pretty
and she had a heart of pure gold. Moreover, she
was a lady, if she did talk so much.</p>

<p>Judith loved Madeleine. For the first time
in her life she felt the stirrings of a really deep
affection for another girl. It had quickened her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
parched soul like the waters of a freshet flowing
through a thirsty land. Madeleine had first
gained the respect of the proud, discontented
girl by being always good-naturedly firm, and
now she had gained her love.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Judith felt for the first time the
pleasure of doing something for someone else.
It was a matter of infinite secret joy to her that
she had been able to help Madeleine with her
studies. In a way she had constituted herself
tutor to the little Southern girl; had criticized
her themes; given her a boost in the dreaded
French Literature and carried her over the
blighting period of mid-year examinations.
Madeleine had spent Christmas with the Blounts
at a boarding house in New York and had given
them a taste of Southern conversation, humor
and anecdotes that had made that dreary time
for them to blossom with new enjoyments.</p>

<p>And now Judith was learning to iron. At first
she handled the iron quite awkwardly, but in a
few minutes she became interested and the pile
of handkerchiefs rapidly decreased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it isn&rsquo;t as if either one of us expects
to have to iron handkerchiefs always,&rdquo;
went on Madeleine, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt us to
know how, just the same, and I have always
found that doing common things well only made
one do uncommon things better. Now, I intend
to be a Professor of Mathematics. I don&rsquo;t know
where nor how, but those are my intentions.
There&rsquo;s no ironing of jabots connected with
mathematics, but somehow I feel that ironing
jabots well makes me more proficient in mathematics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, have you settled on anything to
do yet? It&rsquo;s time you began to think about it,
unless you decide to take a Post Grad. course
and be with me next year. That would be perfectly
grand, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeleine&rsquo;s small pretty hands paused an instant
in their busy fluttering over the garments
she was sprinkling, and she smiled so sweetly
upon Judith that the black-browed young woman
felt moved beyond the power of speech and could
only smile silently in reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, heavens, it was good to have a friend!
Madeleine had come at a time when she most
needed her; when the whole world was nothing
but a black, hideous picture and life was a dreary
waste. Not her mother, not Richard, not Cousin
Edwin, could take the place of Madeleine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I always said I wouldn&rsquo;t work
for a living, Madeleine,&rdquo; she answered presently,
gulping down these new, strange emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, we all say such things, but it&rsquo;s only
talk. And, after all, it&rsquo;s better to work than to
be an object of charity. Think of making your
own money; having it come in every month&mdash;say
a hundred dollars, or even more&mdash;earned by
you? Why, it&rsquo;s glorious. It&rsquo;s better than running
across a gold mine by accident or inheriting
a fortune, because you have done it yourself.
I intend to earn a great deal of money. I shall
rise from being a teacher to having a splendid
school of my own. It will be the most fashionable
school in the South and all the finest families
will send their daughters there. And what will
you be in my school, Judith? Because you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
commence now to work up to that eminence.
Will you be part owner with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an absurd, adorable, sweet child,&rdquo; she
said, and went on ironing busily.</p>

<p>After all, life was not so desperately unpleasant.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door. Judith put
down the iron hastily and retreated to the window.
She had not yet reached the point where
she was willing for others to see her engaged
in this menial work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called Madeleine, without stopping
an instant.</p>

<p>To Judith&rsquo;s relief, however, it was Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A note for you, Miss Blount, and the man&rsquo;s
waiting for an answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith tore open the envelope impatiently. It
was a bill of two years&rsquo; running, amounting to
nearly forty dollars, from the stationery and
candy shop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>On the bottom she was requested to remit at
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the man&mdash;anything, Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly. I
can&rsquo;t see him. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Miss,&rdquo; said the Irish woman with
a good-natured smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These poor young college ladies was in hard
luck just like the men sometimes,&rdquo; she thought
as she turned away.</p>

<p>Judith sat down and began to think. Richard
was having a great struggle to keep her at college,
her mother and himself at the boarding
house, and her father in a sanitarium. It would
really be unkind to burden him with that bill;
but what was to be done?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it that old stationery man again?&rdquo; asked
Madeleine, who had inherited a profound contempt
for dunning shopkeepers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put an advertisement in the
&lsquo;Commune&rsquo;? You have no idea how it will bring
in work. And then hang out a shingle, too.
People have got to learn to recognize you as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
wage-earning person before they come around
and offer you things to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what can I do? I don&rsquo;t know how to
iron well enough to take in laundry, like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A voice outside called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Miss Madeleine Petit&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in. Can&rsquo;t you see the name on the
door?&rdquo; answered Madeleine. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one
Petit at Wellington and I&rsquo;m the lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Millicent Porter now entered.</p>

<p>She looked smaller and more shriveled than
ever in a beautiful mink coat and cap and a velvet
dress of a rich shade of blue that breathed
prosperity in every fold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the region where signs are out asking
for work, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked in a pleasantly
patronizing, unctious voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t ask for work. We announce that
we do it and the work comes,&rdquo; replied Madeleine,
eyeing the visitor with a kind of humorous pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; said Miss Porter, &ldquo;I have
some work I want done and I&rsquo;m looking for a
very competent and reliable person to do it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Judith winced at the word &ldquo;reliable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a servants&rsquo; agency, you know, Miss
Porter,&rdquo; answered the spunky Madeleine. &ldquo;Those
words are generally used when one engages a
cook or a housemaid. What is the work like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give an exhibition of my silver
work at the George Washington Bazaar. I may
sell some of it if I can get the price, and what I
want is a skillful and re&mdash; or rather clever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Madeleine blinked both eyes rapidly at the substitution&mdash;&ldquo;person
to help me get it in order.
Most of it is awfully tarnished and it will need
a good deal of polishing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much will you pay a skillful, clever person?&rdquo;
demanded Madeleine, determined to drive
a good bargain and shrewdly guessing the kind
of person she had to deal with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay ten dollars,&rdquo; answered Millicent glibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are the pieces like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are chains, necklaces, platters and
bowls, and a lot of ivory things I have picked
up in Europe that must be carefully washed.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the work for fifteen dollars,&rdquo; announced
Madeleine. &ldquo;No less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith could hardly preserve a grave countenance
while this bargaining was going on between
the rich Miss Porter and her funny little
Southern friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s too much,&rdquo; declared Millicent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. The work requires care and, as
you say, reliability. It might be stolen, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeleine snapped her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Millicent in a resigned
tone of voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great deal to pay, but I
suppose I can&rsquo;t do any better. I hear you do
everything well, Miss Petit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Blount will do this,&rdquo; answered Madeleine.
&ldquo;If I do things well, she does them better.
Now, where do you want them cleaned? Down
here or up at your place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would never let them out of my studio,&rdquo;
cried Millicent. &ldquo;She must come there, where
she can be under my eye.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; objected Judith, and paused at a
glance from Madeleine.</p>

<p>It would be a crushing blow to her pride for
her to go back to her old rooms and rub tarnished
silver for this perfectly insufferable Millicent
Porter. Yet fifteen dollars loomed up as quite
a considerable sum, and, with five dollars added,
could be paid to the stationery man on account.</p>

<p>Did Judith realize in her secret soul that the
bitter dose she was now swallowing was only
a dose of the same medicine she had once forced
others to swallow?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Madeleine, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll give
you as much of Friday and Saturday as will be
necessary. We&rsquo;ll take a lunch up on Friday so
that we won&rsquo;t have to come back for supper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waited a moment, wondering if Millicent
would not invite them to supper at the Beta Phi.
Hospitality was so much a part of her upbringing
that it was impossible to conceive it lacking
in others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought Miss Blount was to do the work.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She will. I shall work under her as assistant
rubber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, the bargain was clinched and Millicent departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disgusting little reptile!&rdquo; cried Judith when
the sounds of her footsteps died away in the hall
and the door banged behind her.</p>

<p>Could Judith forget that she herself had once
belonged to that overbearing class?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get all stirred up, Judith, it&rsquo;s bad for
your digestion,&rdquo; ejaculated Madeleine. &ldquo;That
girl is nothing but a mere ripple on the surface.
She&rsquo;s ridiculous, but there&rsquo;s no harm in her. I
am really sorry for her, because she doesn&rsquo;t belong
anywhere. She could never make a friend,
and she will never know what it is to be really
liked. She thinks she&rsquo;s a genius because she&rsquo;s
learned how to beat out a few tawdry silver
chains, and as soon as she finishes one she locks
it up in a box and takes it out about once a
decade to look it over. Why, she&rsquo;s just a poor,
starved, little creature without a spark of generosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in her soul. What does she know about
living and happiness?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and I know how to live,&rdquo; Madeleine continued,
flourishing her iron. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the procession.
We&rsquo;re moving on, learning and progressing.
We&rsquo;re going up all the time. I tell
you the highest peak in the Himalayas is not
higher than my ambitions. And I intend to take
you with me, Judith, and when we get to the
top we&rsquo;ll look back and see poor, little Millicent
Porter, shriveled to nothing at the bottom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith gave a strange, hysterical laugh. Suddenly
she flew across the room and embraced
her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could make me do anything, Madeleine,&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Scale the Himalayas or cut a tunnel
through them.&rdquo; Taking her friend&rsquo;s small,
charming face between her two hands, she looked
her in the eyes: &ldquo;Madeleine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did
you know I used to be a blind girl? You have
healed me. I am beginning to see things as they
are.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>A WARNING.</small></h2>


<p>The girl who had been blind and could see
and Madeleine of the unconquerable soul
appeared in Millicent&rsquo;s sumptuous apartment
promptly at three o&rsquo;clock on Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>They carried with them a suitcase containing
the implements of their labor, taken chiefly from
Madeleine&rsquo;s rag bag: some old stockings; several
wornout undervests and polishing cloths
made from antiquated flannel petticoats; also a
bottle of ammonia and two boxes of silver polish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are,&rdquo; announced Madeleine,
unconcernedly, when Millicent had opened her
door to them. &ldquo;I hope you have the things out
and ready. Our time is valuable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of no avail were Millicent&rsquo;s pompous and important
airs. Madeleine insisted on treating her
as a familiar and an equal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have put you in the den. You will be less
disturbed and you can use the writing table to
spread things on. Please be care&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you made an inventory?&rdquo; interrupted
Madeleine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; faltered Millicent. Why was it that
this poverty-stricken little person took all the
wind out of her sails?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it please at once in duplicate. Keep
one yourself and give us the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Millicent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we will not touch a thing until the inventory
is made. No &lsquo;competent, reliable&rsquo; person
would think of doing work like this without
an inventory. We&rsquo;ll wait in the other room until
you have made it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but proceed with the
inventory. It was plain that Madeleine knew
the manner of person she was dealing with.</p>

<p>While the two girls waited in the big sitting
room, now a studio, Madeleine drew a book from
her ulster pocket and began to study. The little
Southerner was never idle one moment of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
waking day and the other seven hours she put
in sleeping very soundly. Judith began to look
about her.</p>

<p>The room was little changed from the old days,
except that it was even richer in aspect. There
were some splendid old altar pieces on the walls
and a piece of beautiful old rose brocade hung
between the studio and the den. But, after all,
what did it come to? Was anyone really fond
of Millicent with all her wealth? Why, Judith,
poor and forgotten, had made a friend. She felt
small tenderness toward the rest of the world,
but she loved Madeleine.</p>

<p>Molly Brown came into the room at this stage
in Judith&rsquo;s reflections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, girls!&rdquo; she exclaimed cordially,
shaking hands with the silver-rubbers. &ldquo;Where
is Millicent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is making an inventory of her valuables
before we begin to clean them,&rdquo; replied Madeleine,
smiling sweetly and blinking both eyes at
once. &ldquo;We insisted, because it would have been
unprofessional not to have had one.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea!&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t.
Besides, you&rsquo;re not professionals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo; insisted Madeleine. &ldquo;Everything
we do for money is professional work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; laughed Molly, &ldquo;and I suppose
you&rsquo;ll polish them up so carefullee that some
day you&rsquo;ll be admirals in the Queen&rsquo;s Navee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing less,&rdquo; said Madeleine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my
theory exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly,&rdquo; called the voice of Millicent from
the den, &ldquo;please come and help me with this
stupid thing. I can&rsquo;t seem to get it straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was how Molly came to be admitted
into Millicent&rsquo;s inner sanctum where she kept her
most valued possessions under lock and key.</p>

<p>The top of a heavy oak chest rested against
the wall and inside was a perfect mine of silver
articles, many of them Millicent&rsquo;s own work;
there was also a quantity of small ivory figures
collected by her in her travels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lift out the things and call their names
and you can copy each one twice, like this: one
silver necklace&mdash;grape-vine design.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly sat down and began to make the list.
They were nearly finished when Rosomond
Chase&rsquo;s voice was heard in the next room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Millicent, please come out for a moment. I
want to see you on business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, left alone, went on with the list, taking
each article from the box and noting it carefully
twice on the inventory.</p>

<p>In the meantime Millicent and her friend were
having a secret conference in the bedroom, while
Madeleine and Judith silently waited in the
studio. The two silver-rubbers were presently
startled by the apparition of Molly standing in
the doorway. She had the look of one fleeing
before a storm, her face very pale and her eyes
dilated with horror. She started to speak, but
checked herself and closed the door behind her.
Then, hurrying into the room, she said in a low,
strained voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madeleine, I would not advise you to do any
work for Miss Porter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls exchanged a long look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo; asked Madeleine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was never more in earnest in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, can&rsquo;t you explain?&rdquo; demanded Judith
Blount.</p>

<p>Molly shook her head and rushed from the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Judith,&rdquo; said Madeleine, slipping
on her ulster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, this is absurd!&rdquo; objected Judith again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; exclaimed her friend, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
know human nature well enough to understand
that a girl like Molly Brown would never have
given a piece of advice like that without knowing
what she was talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s jealous because she would like to earn
the money herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Madeleine. &ldquo;She is not that
kind. You know perfectly well that she is the
most generous-hearted, unselfish girl in Wellington.
She wouldn&rsquo;t injure a fly if she could help
herself, and I think we had better take her advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Judith was stubborn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to do the work. Why go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having once committed herself to this menial
labor, she wished to see it through. After all,
whatever Molly had against Millicent Porter
couldn&rsquo;t concern them, and in the end Madeleine
reluctantly gave in.</p>

<p>Presently Millicent and Rosomond came into
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What became of Molly Brown?&rdquo; demanded
Millicent suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; answered Madeleine
briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there anything the matter with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seemed in perfectly good health as far as
I know, but you had better hurry up with the
inventory, Miss Porter. We are losing time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosomond <a name="helped" id="helped"></a>helped Millicent with the remainder
of the list, and by four o&rsquo;clock Madeleine
and Judith were installed in the den hard
at work. All afternoon and evening they toiled
and the next morning they appeared soon after
breakfast and started in again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is easier than cracking rock, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
pay is considerably better, but I am just as tired
between the shoulders as a common laborer,&rdquo;
Madeleine exclaimed, rubbing the last tray until
she could see her own piquant little face reflected
in its depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for me, I feel as if I had been drawn and
quartered,&rdquo; complained Judith. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth
more than fifteen dollars. We should have asked
twenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have asked it, if I had thought she
could have been induced to part with so much
money, but I saw that fifteen was her limit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a regular little bargain driver,&rdquo; she
said admiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not always,&rdquo; answered Madeleine.
&ldquo;Only when I meet another one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad we undertook it, and I am
gladder still we have finished it,&rdquo; said Judith.</p>

<p>They arranged the silver on half of the table,
and the small army of carved ivory ornaments,
for which Millicent seemed to have a passion, on
the other half. Then, removing the loose gloves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
which had protected their hands, they put on
their things and marched into the next room
with expectant faces. For the first time in all
her life Judith had earned a sum of money, and
the humblest wage-earner was not more anxious
for his week&rsquo;s pay than she was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please inspect the work, Miss Porter,
and give us our money? We are tired and
want to go home,&rdquo; said Madeleine.</p>

<p>Millicent was propped up against some velvet
cushions in the window seat. There was an expression
of nervous worry on her thin sallow
face, and around her on the floor lay the scattered
bits of a note she had read, re-read, and
torn into little pieces.</p>

<p>She was in a very bad humor, and her warped
nature was groping for something on which to
vent its accumulated spleen. She rose from the
window seat, swept grandly into the next room
and glanced at the tableful of silver and ivory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks fairly well,&rdquo; she said; for Millicent
was one of those persons who grudged even her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
praise. &ldquo;What was the amount I promised to
pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you haven&rsquo;t forgotten it so soon,&rdquo;
answered the intrepid Madeleine. &ldquo;Fifteen dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, was it so much? Will this evening do?
I haven&rsquo;t that sum on hand just now. I&rsquo;ll have
to go down to the bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A check will do, then,&rdquo; said Madeleine, sitting
down in one of the carved chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never pay with checks. I only pay cash. I
would prefer to draw out the money and pay you
this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; exclaimed Madeleine. &ldquo;Besides,
you know very well that the bank closes on Saturdays
at noon, and it&rsquo;s now nearly four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it does. Then you will have to wait until
Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t wait until Monday,&rdquo; ejaculated
Madeleine. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been rubbing silver
for our health. You&rsquo;d better look around in
your top drawer and see if you can&rsquo;t scrape fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
dollars together, because I tell you plainly
if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll regret it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How regret it?&rdquo; asked the other suspiciously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not obliged to pay it until Monday, and I
won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she added stubbornly.</p>

<p>It was growing late. The girls were exhausted
and hungry. They had eaten no lunch except
crackers and cheese. At last Judith, utterly
crushed with disappointment, drew Madeleine
aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we leave her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
stand it any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without another word they took their departure,
<a name="leaving" id="leaving"></a>leaving Millicent still in the window seat
looking pensively out on the campus. They were
hardly outside before she sprang to the door and
locked it. Then she hastened to the den and began
to pack feverishly and with trembling nervous
hands. Wrapping each article of silver in
tissue paper, she placed it in the chest on a bed
of raw cotton. When the table was entirely
cleared, she closed and locked the chest and, addressing
a tag, wired it to the handle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Next she drew a trunk from the big closet
and packed it with her best clothes. This done,
she crept downstairs to the telephone and engaged
Mr. Murphy to call that night for an express
box and a trunk.</p>

<p>The Beta Phi girls were all at a Saturday
night dance at one of the other houses when Mr.
Murphy called. Millicent explained to the matron
that her rooms were too crowded and she
was sending some of her things back to New
York.</p>

<p>As quietly as possible she drew her other two
trunks from the closet, and by three in the morning
the rooms were entirely dismantled and all
drapery and pictures carefully packed away.
These also she locked and tagged with the precision
of one who intends to lose nothing, no
matter what&rsquo;s to pay. One more task remained.
This was performed in the privacy of the den
behind closed doors. When it was done there
stood on the table a square box addressed in artistic
lettering to &ldquo;Miss M. Brown, No.&nbsp;5 Quadrangle.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Placing her watch on her pillow, Millicent
now rested for several hours without sleeping.
At last, at seven o&rsquo;clock, dressed for a journey,
with suit case, umbrella and hand bag, she crept
softly downstairs and plunged into the early
morning mists.</p>

<p>Not once did she glance back at the two gray
towers as she hastened down to the station, and
when the seven-thirty train for New York pulled
in, she boarded it quickly and turned her face
away from Wellington forever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>THE PARABLE OF THE SUN AND WIND.</small></h2>


<p>If Molly had been carrying a stick of dynamite
she could not have held it more gingerly
than the square box she was taking to President
Walker on Monday morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the reason I never liked her,&rdquo; she
thought, mentioning no names even in her own
mind. &ldquo;I wonder if it is true that she couldn&rsquo;t
help it. It must be, when she was so rich. What
could she want with Minerva&rsquo;s medals or Margaret&rsquo;s
initialed ring? Both M&rsquo;s, though,&rdquo; she
thought, half smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Brown,&rdquo; cried a voice behind her,
and Madeleine Petit came tearing across the
campus as fast as her little feet could carry her.
&ldquo;Is it true that Millicent Porter has run away
from college?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is,&rdquo; answered Molly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She owed us fifteen dollars,&rdquo; cried Madeleine
tragically. &ldquo;She promised to pay this morning,
and I have just heard rumors that she has disappeared,
bag and baggage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>did</em> do the work for her?&rdquo; asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, really, against my will. I knew you
would never advise without having something to
advise about. But Judith was determined, and
the only reason I gave in was because she had
never done any work before, and I thought it
would be good for her to make a start. She was
so happy over earning the money. It was really
wonderful to see how she brightened up. And
when we couldn&rsquo;t get a cent out of Miss Porter
on Saturday afternoon, poor old Judith was so
disappointed that she cried. Think of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a shame,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, appreciating
Judith&rsquo;s feelings with entire sympathy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure I should have cried if I had done all that
hard work and then couldn&rsquo;t collect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are we to do? Must we sit back
quietly and let the rich trample the poor? Don&rsquo;t
you think she is coming back?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find out something those few minutes
you were in the den?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly nodded her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls exchanged frightened glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her father a millionaire, too! Well, I
never,&rdquo; cried Madeleine. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll just drop
him a letter,&rdquo; which she accordingly did that very
day. But she never received an answer, and
the debt still remains unpaid.</p>

<p>In the meantime Molly was closeted with Miss
Walker for ten minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said the President. &ldquo;I just
had a letter this morning from an old friend at
the head of a private school warning me about
this unfortunate girl who was a pupil there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Molly was loath to discuss the matter,
and still more loath to keep stolen property in
her private possession. She placed the box on
the President&rsquo;s desk and hastened away as soon
as she politely could. That afternoon there appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
on the bulletin board the following unusual
announcement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;All those who have lost property during the
winter may possibly be able to obtain it by applying
to the Secretary of the President.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>That the thief had been apprehended at last
was of course understood. Putting two and two
together, the Wellington girls concluded that
Millicent Porter must have had some important
reason for fleeing early in the morning without
explanations, leaving two trunks and a debt of
honor behind her. The trunks were afterwards
expressed, according to directions left in her
room.</p>

<p>But, for the honor of Wellington, open conversation
on the subject was not encouraged, and
most of the talk was in whispers behind closed
doors.</p>

<p>A crowd of the girls from the Quadrangle,
where most of the pilfering had been carried on,
went together to claim their property on Monday
evening. Those who had lost money returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
disappointed. The box of restored goods
contained none whatever. But the other articles
were duly claimed and distributed, with the exception
of one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does any one know to whom this belongs?&rdquo;
asked the secretary, placing a photograph in a
beautiful silver frame on the top of the desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be yours, Nance,&rdquo; announced Edith
Williams, with a teasing smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; said Nance emphatically.</p>

<p>The other girls, now gathered around the picture,
began to laugh.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the small lanky boy in kilts in
the photograph was Andy McLean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is Mrs. McLean&rsquo;s,&rdquo; suggested
some one.</p>

<p>Margaret, examining the frame with the eye
of an experienced detective, remarked in her
usual authoritative tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The design on the frame is Japanese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otoyo,&rdquo; cried Judy, and the little Japanese,
lingering near the door, crept timidly up and
claimed the picture. Her face was a deep scarlet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
as, with drooping head, she rushed from the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless the child&rsquo;s heart, who&rsquo;d have thought
she had a boy&rsquo;s picture,&rdquo; laughed Katherine
Williams.</p>

<p>That very night Otoyo returned the photograph
to Mrs. McLean, and with many tears
confessed that she had removed it from the
drawer without so much as asking permission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sweet lass,&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor&rsquo;s wife,
kissing her, &ldquo;you shall have a good picture of
Andy if you like, taken just lately. I am only
too happy that you admire his picture enough
to put it in that beautiful frame. I&rsquo;m sure I
think he&rsquo;s a braw lad, the handsomest in three
kingdoms; but I am his mother, you know, and
not accountable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Together the two women fitted the latest
photograph of the callow youth into the frame.
Otoyo presently bore it triumphantly back to
her room and placed it on the mantel shelf
where all the world could see it. That night she
slept with an easy conscience and a thankful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
heart. Her one dishonest deed was wiped out
forever.</p>

<p>The untangling of one snarl in the skein of
affairs generally leads to the untangling of many
others. So it happened that Molly and Judy, by
the turn which events had taken, were able to
clear up a mystery that had puzzled them for
months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel, Judy,&rdquo; remarked Molly, one day, &ldquo;that
we ought to do something nice for Minerva Higgins,
because of&mdash;you know what. We mentioned
no names and never breathed it even to
each other except vaguely Christmas day, you
remember. But we did suspect her, and thinking
is just as bad as talking when you think a
thing like that, so cruel and horrible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy nodded her head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she will never know we are making reparation,
Molly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will have to be
purely for our own private satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Molly. &ldquo;That is what I
meant. We did her a wrong in our minds, and
in our minds we must undo it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And how, pray?&rdquo; demanded Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let me see. Couldn&rsquo;t we ask her here
some night with just the three of us, and make
her fudge and be awfully sweet and interested?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we could, if we made a superhuman
mental and physical effort,&rdquo; answered Judy
lazily. &ldquo;And it would take both. Why not let
well enough alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;well enough,&rsquo; Judy, and we&rsquo;ve
had an ugly thought about her for weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you call those practical jokes she played
on us last autumn pretty?&rdquo; demanded Judy, who
had no liking for Minerva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but she has learned better now. Anyhow,
Judy, I want to try an experiment. Do
you remember the allegory of the sun and the
wind and the man wrapped in his cloak? The
wind made a wager with the sun that he could
make the man take off his cloak, and he blew
and blew with all his might, and the more he
blew the closer the man wrapped his coat about
him. Then the wind gave up and the sun came
out and tried his method of just shining very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
brightly and cheerfully, and presently the man
was so hot he took off his coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning, I suppose, that we have been trying
the human gale method instead of the merry
little sunshine way. All right, Molly, dearest,
bring on your Minerva and I&rsquo;ll be as gentle as
a May morning. But don&rsquo;t let the Gemini come,
because we could never carry it through if they
were present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was agreed that the three friends, Molly,
Nance and Judy, should entertain the vain little
freshman at an exclusive party all to themselves.
Other persons were advised to keep away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands off,&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;Stay away
from our premises this evening, ladies, because
we are going to try an experiment with explosives,
and it might be dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that, on the very evening
that Minerva Higgins had arranged to go to
the three friends, somebody played a practical
joke on her and she was in an extremely bad
humor. Although she had regained her two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
medals, she was always losing things and crying
her losses up and down the corridor. She usually
found the articles mislaid in her own room,
but she had a suspicious nature and was generally
on the lookout for thefts. That afternoon
she had rushed into the corridor crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My water pitcher has been stolen from me.
I will not have people going into my room and
taking my things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if anybody wanted her old water pitcher,&rdquo;
remarked Margaret, in a tone of disgust.</p>

<p>Edith Williams smiled mysteriously.</p>

<p>Presently Minerva and the matron, much
bored, passed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go and see the fun,&rdquo; suggested
Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know there will be any fun?&rdquo;
demanded Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s likely to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They strolled slowly up the corridor, and as
they passed the door the matron was saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Miss Higgins, I must request you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
not to raise any more false alarms like this.
There is your water pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pointed to the chandelier where the
pitcher had been hoisted on a piece of cord. A
good many other girls had gathered about Minerva&rsquo;s
door, and a ripple of laughter swept along
the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edith, did you play that joke?&rdquo; asked Margaret
later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy was a party to it, and Katherine and
several others,&rdquo; answered Edith evasively. &ldquo;We
thought it high time to put an end to burglar
alarms. Minerva Higgins has come to be a public
nuisance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret smiled. Her dignity would never
allow her to enter into what she called &ldquo;rowdy
jokes.&rdquo; However, it did not mar her enjoyment
of the story about them afterward.</p>

<p>But it was an angry, sullen Minerva who presented
herself at the door of No.&nbsp;5, Quadrangle,
that evening at eight o&rsquo;clock. She had left off
her medals and she had not worn the indigo blue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Judy was relieved at this, but Molly and Nance
considered it a bad sign.</p>

<p>The first half-hour of the reparation party
dragged slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve piped for Minerva and she will not
dance; we&rsquo;ve mourned for her and she will not
mourn. It&rsquo;s a hopeless case,&rdquo; Judy remarked
in an aside to Nance.</p>

<p>But Molly had formed a resolution and she
was determined to carry it through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behind that Chinese wall of vanity, Minerva
has a little soul hidden somewhere and I&rsquo;m going
to reach it to-night if I have to blast with
dynamite,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>Nance was stirring fudge on the chafing dish
and Judy was occupying herself strumming
chords on the piano. Molly led Minerva to the
divan and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you glad you came to college, Minerva?&rdquo;
she asked, wondering what in the world to talk
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the other emphatically. &ldquo;I
detest college. Except that the studies are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
higher, I think Mill Town High School is better
run. I don&rsquo;t like college girls, either. They are
all conceited snobs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will like it better when you are
a sophomore and have more liberty,&rdquo; suggested
Molly. &ldquo;The first year one can&rsquo;t look forward
to much pleasure. But a freshman is always under
inspection, you see. If she accepts the situation
without complaining and is nice and obliging
and modest, it&rsquo;s like so much treasure laid
by for her the next year when she finds how
popular she is with the other girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that in Mill Town. A freshman
is just as good as anybody else,&rdquo; snapped
Minerva.</p>

<p>Judy, overhearing this statement, blinked at
Nance, who smiled furtively and went on stirring
fudge.</p>

<p>Molly still persisted with the patience of one
who looks for certain success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most interesting part of being a freshman,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;is that a girl begins to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
out about herself, and by the time she&rsquo;s a sophomore
she knows what she really wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I knew perfectly well what I wanted
before I came,&rdquo; interrupted Minerva in a lofty
tone, &ldquo;I want to study the dead languages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is something you want more than
that,&rdquo; broke in Molly. &ldquo;You want to be
popular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minerva gave her a suspicious glance, but
Molly was beaming kindly upon her with all the
warmth of her affectionate nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; she demanded in
a somewhat softened tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not hard to guess. You said you were
disappointed with the girls here because they
seemed to be snobs. Now if you hadn&rsquo;t minded
it very much, you never would have mentioned
it. Don&rsquo;t you think the girls are just a little
afraid of you? You see, they had heard you
were the brightest girl in your school and when
they saw all the medals and you talked to them
on such deep subjects, they were scared off. They
thought, perhaps, you wouldn&rsquo;t care for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
because they didn&rsquo;t know enough. After all, people&rsquo;s
feeling toward you is just a reflection of
what you feel toward them. If you are interested
and admire and love them, they are pretty
sure to feel the same toward you. You see, I
know you can be just as nice and human and
everyday as the rest of us&mdash;&rdquo; Molly laid her hand
on Minerva&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;but the others haven&rsquo;t had a
chance yet to find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minerva&rsquo;s stiff figure relaxed a little and she
leaned against Molly confidingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do want to be liked,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;All
my life I&rsquo;ve wanted it more than anything in
the world. But even at Mill Town the girls were
afraid of me, just as you say they are here. I
might as well own up, as you have guessed it
already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only a question of time now before
you make lots of friends,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;You are
so clever that you&rsquo;ll find out how to make them
like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;I think people who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
sympathetic and who listen more than they talk
generally have a good many friends. I&rsquo;m afraid
I&rsquo;ve talked more than I listened this evening,&rdquo;
she added, pinching Minerva&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve talked about me,&rdquo; answered
Minerva. Suddenly her face turned very red
and her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;I shall not wear
the medals any more,&rdquo; she whispered unsteadily.
&ldquo;And&mdash;there is something I want to confess.
I&mdash;I waited for you that night you were on the
lake, and I sent an unsigned note to Miss Walker
the next day to get even with you because you
wouldn&rsquo;t let me go walking with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy, at the piano, was singing a vociferous
medley, and Nance was joining in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; whispered Molly. &ldquo;It was
much better for her to know because we would
have been misrepresented always unless someone
had told her, and we couldn&rsquo;t exactly tell her
ourselves. But I think it&rsquo;s awfully nice of you
to confess, Minerva. Now, we shall be better
friends than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls kissed each other. The cloak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of vanity had slipped off and the smartest-girl-in-Mill-Town-High-School
became her real natural
self.</p>

<p>Until a quarter before ten the four girls
laughed and talked pleasantly together, while the
convivial fudge plate was passed from one to
the other. But never once did Mill Town High
School or comparative philology come into the
conversation.</p>

<p>When at last the evening was at an end and
Minerva had departed, Nance and Judy led Molly
gravely to the divan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, tell us how you did it,&rdquo; they demanded
in one voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only told her the truth,&rdquo; answered Molly,
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t put it so that it would hurt her. I
said the reason why the girls were stand-offish
was because they were afraid of her learning
and her gold medals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marvelous, brilliant creature!&rdquo; cried Judy,
embracing her friend, while Nance laid a cheek
against Molly&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a perfect darling, Molly,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<span class="i0">We greet thy towers and cloisters gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy meadows fresh in spring array;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We greet thee, Wellington, to-day;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We greet thee far and near.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Molly and Judy were responsible for the words
of these stirring lines, which with three other
verses were sung by the junior class to the air
of &ldquo;Beulah Land,&rdquo; the music having been
adapted to the words rather than the words to
the music.</p>

<p>The entire junior class, a long, slender line
of swaying white stretched across the campus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
lifted its voice in praise of Wellington that May
Day morning at the Junior Gambol. In the center
waved the class flag of primrose and lavender.
In the background was the gray pile of
Wellington and in the front stretched the level
close-cut lawn of the campus, fringed by the
crowd of spectators. It was an impressive sight
and when the fresh young voices united in the
class song of &ldquo;Hail, Wellington!&rdquo;, Miss Walker
was moved to tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dear children!&rdquo; she exclaimed to Professor
Green at her side, &ldquo;really I feel all choked
up over their devotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Winding in and out in an intricate march, the
class moved slowly across the campus until it
reached the sophomores grouped together in one
spot. Here they paused while the President of
the juniors made a speech and presented the
President of the sophomores with a small spade
wreathed in smilax, a symbol of learning, or
rather of the delving for learning which that
class had in prospect in another year. Next the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
juniors approached the seniors and sang one of
the Wellington songs, &ldquo;Seniors, Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the line broke up and moved to the center
of the campus, where stood a May pole. An
orchestra, stationed under one of the trees, began
playing an old English country dance, and
the juniors seized the streamers and tripped in
and out with the graceful dignity suitable to their
new, uplifted position of seniors about-to-be.</p>

<p>Not one of the Wellington festivals could so
stir her daughters of the present or the past,
now grouped on the edge of the campus, as this
Junior May-Day Gambol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is so sad because it is so beautiful,&rdquo;
Miss Pomeroy observed to Miss Bowles,
teacher in Higher Mathematics, wiping her eyes
furtively. But Miss Bowles, not being an ex-daughter
of Wellington, and having a taste for
more prosaic and practical pleasures, regarded
the scene with only a polite and tolerant interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is to be the May Queen?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
McLean, standing in the same group with Miss
Walker and Professor Green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>As each succeeding year brought around the
Junior Gambol the good woman hastened to view
it with undiminished interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be difficult to say,&rdquo; answered Miss
Walker. &ldquo;In a class of such unusual individuality
it will be very hard to select one who deserves
it more than another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of popularity more than intelligence,&rdquo;
observed the Professor. &ldquo;I think I
might hazard a guess,&rdquo; he added in a lower tone,
but his voice was drowned in a burst of music.
The juniors were singing an old English glee
song, &ldquo;To the Cuckoo.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Hail, beauteous stranger of the grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou messenger of spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now heaven repairs thy rural seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And woods thy welcome ring.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Many guesses were hazarded regarding the
junior May Queen, not only among the crowds
of spectators, but in the class itself.</p>

<p>The votes for the Queen were cast by secret
ballot in charge of a committee of three. Wellington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
traditions required that the name of the
chosen one should be kept in entire secrecy until
the clock in the tower struck noon on May Day.
Then the junior donkey was led forth garlanded
with flowers. He had officiated on this occasion
now for ten years. This was the great moment
when the identity of the most popular girl in the
junior class was established for all time, and it
was an important moment, because the one selected
was generally chosen as Class President
the next year.</p>

<p>And now, as the tower clock boomed twelve
deep strokes, there was a stirring among the
spectators and a craning of necks. Three juniors
appeared at the end of the campus, leading
the aged donkey, who flicked his tail and walked
gingerly over the turf. He wore a garland of
daffodils and lilacs and moved sedately along,
mindful of the importance of his position.</p>

<p>The three girls were Nance Oldham, Caroline
Brinton and Edith Williams. One of them carried
a wreath of narcissus and the other two
held the ribbon reins of the donkey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the time-honored rule, they approached
their classmates with grave, still faces.
It was really a solemn moment and the juniors
waiting in an unbroken line never moved nor
smiled.</p>

<p>The spectators held their breath and for a moment
Wellington was so still that every human
thing in it might have been turned to stone.</p>

<p>Why was it so exciting, this choosing of the
May Queen?</p>

<p>No one could tell, and yet it was always the
same. Even Miss Bowles felt a lump rise in
her throat. Many of the alumnæ shamelessly
wept, and Professor Green, watching the three
white figures move slowly in front of the line of
juniors, wondered if no one else could hear the
pounding of his pulses.</p>

<p>Presently the committee came to a stop. The
Professor thrust his hands into his pockets and
drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>Nance stepped forward and placed the wreath
on somebody&rsquo;s head. The spectators could see
that she was quite tall and slender, and that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
shrank back with surprise and shyness as she was
led forth and bidden to mount the donkey, which
she did with perfect ease and grace, as one who
has mounted horses all her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; cried a dozen voices. &ldquo;They look
so much alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scores of opera glasses and field glasses were
raised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Molly Brown, of course,&rdquo; cried a girl.</p>

<p>The Professor smiled happily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he repeated, thrusting his hands
deeper into his pockets.</p>

<p>And now the ban of silence was lifted. The
orchestra played; the audience cheered and the
three classes gave their particular yells in turn,
while the juniors, marching two by two, followed
Molly Brown, riding the donkey, around the entire
circuit of the campus.</p>

<p>As for Molly Brown, she hung her head and
blushed, looking neither to the right nor to the
left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sweet lass, she might be a bride, she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
so shy!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. McLean as the procession
moved slowly by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Miss Molly Brown of Kentucky!&rdquo;
yelled a group of Exmoor students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to Molly Brown, drink her down,&rsquo;&rdquo;
sang the entire student body of Wellington.</p>

<p>It was a thing that happened every year and
there were those who had seen it thirty times
or more, and still the spectacle was ever new.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I must be dreaming,&rdquo; Molly was saying
to herself. &ldquo;Of course, I might have known
Nance and Judy would have voted for me and
perhaps one or two others,&mdash;but so many&mdash;and
what have I done to deserve it? I have hardly
seen anything of Caroline Brinton and her
crowd. &lsquo;Oh Lord, make me thankful for these
and all thy mercies,&rsquo;&rdquo; she added, repeating the
family grace, which somehow seemed appropriate
to this stirring moment.</p>

<p>After the triumphal march, Molly with the
class officers, flanked by the rest of the class, held
an informal reception on the lawn. This was
followed by the Junior Lunch, quite an elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
affair, served in the gymnasium, decorated for
the occasion by the sophomores.</p>

<p>Lawrence Upton was Molly&rsquo;s guest for the
day. Many of the girls had asked Exmoor students,
but Nance had been visited with a disappointment
that was too amusing to be annoying.</p>

<p>Otoyo Sen, on the sophomore committee for
decorating the gymnasium, and therefore entitled
to ask a guest, had not let the grass grow under
her little feet one instant. The moment the committee
had been selected, she sent off a formal,
polite note to Andy McLean, 2nd, inviting him
to be her guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nance, that&rsquo;s one on you,&rdquo; cried Judy,
when she heard this bit of news. &ldquo;You always
thought Andy was so much your property that
no one would ever think of treading on your preserves.
It&rsquo;s just like Japan, creeping quietly in
and taking possession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Andy will be hurt because I didn&rsquo;t
get there first,&rdquo; replied Nance, laughing good-naturedly.
&ldquo;I suppose I shall have to ask Louis
Allen, but I don&rsquo;t think it will do Andy any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
harm to know there are other fishes in the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Judy. &ldquo;Nance
is learning a thing or two,&rdquo; she added to herself.</p>

<p>But all&rsquo;s fair in love and war, and there was
no more charming figure on the campus that day
than little Otoyo in a pink organdy and a large
hat trimmed with pink roses. On her face was
an expression of shy, discreet triumph as of one
who has gained a victory by stratagem.</p>

<p>The Junior Gambol came to an end at six that
evening, and the tired students repaired to their
rooms to rest and relax after eight hours of
continuous entertaining. The eight friends of
old Queen&rsquo;s days had gathered in No.&nbsp;5 of the
Quadrangle, where refreshments were being
handed around, chiefly lemonade and hickory-nut
cake. Eight limp young women in dressing-gowns
draped themselves about the divans and
in the arm chairs to discuss the joys of the day.</p>

<p>Molly, at the window, was reading something
written on a card tied to the stem of an exceedingly
large yellow apple. It was Professor Edwin
Green&rsquo;s card, and the inscription thereon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
read: &ldquo;The first of the three golden apples was
won to-day. Congratulations and best wishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Untying the card, she slipped it into her portfolio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I divide it or eat it alone?&rdquo; she asked
herself, and, without waiting for the second
voice to answer, she seized Judy&rsquo;s silver knife
and divided the apple into eight sections, which
she passed around the company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did this come from the Garden of Hesperides,
Molly?&rdquo; asked Edith Williams, always ready
with her classic allusions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it did,&rdquo; answered
Molly, smiling mysteriously.</p>

<p>There was much to talk about that evening.
It was the moment for reminiscences and they
reviewed the past year with all its excitements
and pleasures. When Millicent Porter had departed
from Wellington in dishonorable flight,
her place in the Shakespeareans had been immediately
filled, and Judy Kean was the girl selected;
which goes to show that after a good
deal of suffering and when the edge is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
off the appetite, we generally get what we once
earnestly desired. Judy was not excited over
the honor paid her, but she acquitted herself
creditably in the beautiful performance of &ldquo;A
Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; which the society eventually produced.</p>

<p>She sat on the floor now, leaning against
Molly, whom, next to her father and mother,
she loved best in all the world. Without realizing
it herself, Judy&rsquo;s character had been wonderfully
developed and strengthened by the events
of that winter and she looked on the world with
a new and broader vision.</p>

<p>It was nearly bedtime; the night was warm
and still and through the open windows came
the sound of singing. The girls were silent for
a while, too weary to make any more conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And next year we&rsquo;ll be hoary old seniors,&rdquo;
suddenly announced Judy, following up a train
of thought.</p>

<p>Several in the company sighed audibly. Already
the thought of parting from each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and from their beloved Wellington cast a shadow
before it.</p>

<p>But this sorrowful last year was to be filled
with interest and happy times, as you will see
who read the next volume of this series, entitled
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Molly Brown&rsquo;s Senior Days</span>.&rdquo;</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
